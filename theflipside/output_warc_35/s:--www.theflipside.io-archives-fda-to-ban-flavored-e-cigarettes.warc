E-cigarette use was up by nearly 50 percent among middle schoolers in the same period. More than three and a half million American children now use e-cigarettes, with 97 percent of users aged 12 to 17 choosing flavored products… E-cigarette companies insist their goal is to help people quit smoking. But 13-year-olds don’t start using cotton-candy-flavored pods for Juul devices to kick a cigarette habit. Much more often, e-cigarettes lead kids directly to nicotine addiction… <br><br>“To those of us on the front lines of the fight against tobacco use, the tactics companies are employing to sell e-cigarettes — flavorings, unfounded health claims and the hiring of celebrity promoters — are all too familiar. They are the same strategies that tobacco companies have long used to get kids to try cigarettes. There’s still much we don’t know about the connection between lung illness and vaping. &nbsp;But we do know that one Juul pod contains about as much nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes, and that nicotine harms brain development… <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/opinion/vape-deaths-children-bloomberg.html" data-rt-link-type="external">Banning flavored e-cigarettes is the most important thing we can do to reduce use among young people</a>.”<br><strong>Michael R.

The FDA sent a warning letter on Monday to the most popular vaping manufacturer, Juul Labs, complaining the company has made claims in school presentations that its products are less dangerous than tobacco without an appropriate FDA order. The FDA must remain vigilant against marketing to and use of vaping by young people. Overall, this is a complex problem of science, business, technology, culture and public health. Vaping began with very little regulation. Whatever the outcome of the current spate of illness, <a href="https://beta.washingtonpost.com/opinions/everyone-should-be-alarmed-by-the-vaping-crisis/2019/09/09/1f2413f8-d329-11e9-9343-40db57cf6abd_story.html" data-rt-link-type="external">it is now clear that in the public interest, it must be rigorously scrutinized and controlled</a>.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>It’s worth noting that “evidence that these products help people avoid combustible cigarettes is limited.

Then there’s the black market: The devices people are buying on the street and the liquids used in them demand more attention.

Still, the Trump administration, willing to act fast when it comes to mango-flavored vaping liquid, has backed away several times from the idea of passing universal background checks on gun purchases. Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported an assault weapons ban but hasn't embraced the idea in office. The Odessa, Texas, shooter who killed seven people in August and wounded 22 others had previously failed a background check and purchased the AR-style rifle used in the attack through a private sale, avoiding a background check… The administration says vaping is a deeply concerning epidemic but is turning a blind eye to another, much more deadly health crisis: gun violence.”<br><strong>Susan Rinkunas, Vice</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-25/trump-ukraine-call-transcript-has-impeachment-worthy-evidence?srnd=opinion">Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time</a>.

There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”<br/><strong>Noah Feldman, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

One: Leaving tobacco-flavored e-cigs on the market risks funneling kids who currently get their nicotine fix from fruit-flavored candy-like products towards something that tastes much more like real cigarettes. If the fear with vaping is that it’s a gateway drug for tobacco products, why the hell would you want to <a href="https://hotair.com/archives/allahpundit/2019/09/11/trump-administration-may-ban-flavored-vaping-products/" data-rt-link-type="external">condition children to crave nicotine that tastes like tobacco</a>?... [and] Although scientists are unsure what’s causing the cases of lung disease, even critics of vaping like former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb suspect that black-market products are to blame.

It’s unfair to blame a whole category of products on the bad actions of illegal actors. An analogous situation would be if Kentucky started banning the sale of moonshine by legal distillers because a black market batch caused some drinkers to go blind. In both cases, government action in the form of investigation, prosecution, and issuing health guidelines may certainly be justified. However, a broad-stroke ban against otherwise legal, health-certified products would be government overreach.”<br><strong>Casey Given, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Some, however, argue that “according to research out of the University of California-San Francisco, smoking e-cigarettes daily doubles your risk of a heart attack and when combined with traditional cigarettes, your risk increases five-fold… study after study has shown that while using e-cigs is not as bad as smoking traditional cigarettes, they are just as addictive.

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.
