And it will lead inevitably, consistent with partisan self-interest, to fewer competitive general elections, pushing political power at the congressional and state legislative level further toward the extremes -- and those bodies usually are the breeding ground for our senators, governors and presidents. Washington's inability to reason together to solve common problems is a result of this rot, and it's about to get far worse… <br><br>“The chief justice expressed faith in the fact that redistricting reforms are going forward on a state-by-state basis. But his faith belies the obvious fact that those reform efforts are almost always the result of ballot initiatives, in which concerned citizens have bypassed the state legislatures out of necessity. And even that's not always enough. In Missouri, voters approved a nonpartisan redistricting reform initiative in 2018, and afterward, Republican Gov. Mike Parson led an effort to repeal it, saying that the issue was too complicated for ‘the standard person’ to grasp.

The court effectively put the fox in charge of the hen house. The majority decision is also anti-historical: the court can – and does – create legal standards, as it has in so many other areas, for when gerrymandering goes too far and violates the constitution. The court did exactly this in the 1960s, when it held that malapportionment of state legislatures violated the constitution. Prior to that, many state legislatures were badly malapportioned – there might be one district with 50,000 people and another with 250,000… The court should have dealt with partisan gerrymandering the same way.”<br><strong>Erwin Chemerinsky, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Roberts doesn’t dispute the toxic evils of partisan gerrymandering.

Some states have addressed the issue by passing their own laws or constitutional amendments regulating how districts are drawn, which is an effective practical solution. But the Supreme Court cannot invent a standard out of whole cloth to govern redistricting questions – that is a task committed by the Constitution to the state and federal legislatures… <br><br>“While Courts do have a constitutional role in ensuring elections are free of racial discrimination, the same can’t be said of political jockeying. &nbsp;Nothing in the Constitution forbids political and even partisan forces from playing a role in elections; indeed they are virtually unavoidable.

The only reason Democrats are screaming now is because they lost so badly in 2010, giving Republicans the ability to draw congressional lines for the past decade. Prior to 2010, Democrats controlled most state legislatures and controlled Congress until the mid-'90s. As the South and Midwest slipped away, so to did their abilities to draw lines. Then, suddenly, gerrymandering became a problem… Instead of complaining about the rules we have had for 200 years — rules under which Democrats were winning just eight years ago — <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/49004/erickson-maybe-try-winning-erick-erickson" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">perhaps they should try winning </a>instead.”<br><strong>Erick Erickson, Daily Wire</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Furthermore, “computer modeling has suggested that most of the Republican advantage in congressional districts can be explained by residential patterns (i.e., Democratic concentration in urban areas) rather than partisan mapmaking. To the extent that progressive critics wanted the courts to get involved not only in preventing partisan gerrymandering but in drawing lines to help Democrats out of a natural disadvantage, it is easy to see why the justices were hesitant to get into that business… <br><br>“<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/how-much-does-gerrymandering-really-matter/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">The reality is that the observable impact of partisan gerrymanders on partisan control of the House of Representatives is fairly modest</a>, prone to breaking down over time, and no barrier to frequent changes in control of the chamber. It is not a problem requiring radical solutions, and it is one we can work out without involving the courts.”<br><strong>Dan McLaughlin, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding the census, “the administration’s process was chaotic and unprofessional, leaving behind a trail of evidence that the government’s stated justification for the citizenship question (that it would aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act) may have been a pretext… But as Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito spelled out in separate opinions, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/supreme-court-decisions-gerrymandering-right-census-wrong/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">it is not the Court’s job to play psychoanalyst</a>, and the decision paves the way for courts to scrutinize policymakers’ motives much more broadly… &nbsp;The census has asked about citizenship numerous times stretching back about two centuries. The Court’s job was to make sure the administration had an adequate explanation for adding the question back in — as Roberts conceded it did — not to look behind that explanation for ulterior motives.”<br><strong>The Editors, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“As the Supreme Court noted, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hans-von-spakovsky-census-should-ask-about-citizenship-but-supreme-court-fails-to-resolve-issue" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">all but one census taken from 1820 to 2000 included a question about citizenship or place of birth for at least some portion of the population</a>. And since 2000, a citizenship question has been on the American Community Survey – a mini-census sent out every year to a large sample of American households… The question now is whether Justice Department lawyers can produce evidence needed to convince the lower court to approve the citizenship question before time runs out, or whether the census can be postponed to give the administration more time.”<br><strong>Hans von Spakovsky, Fox News</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“If the Secretary can muster up an alternate justification--for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMBlackman/status/1144619732257181696" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the states are interested in using citizen data to draw their maps</a>--then the census question will survive.”<br><strong>Josh Blackman, Twitter</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>.

If the government actually managed to collect it, their fortunes would rapidly erode — and so would tax collections. The plan might be a good way to smash wealth, but it’s a terrible way to fund the nation’s health-care system… <br/><br/>“If Warren makes it to the White House, and tries to pass a plan, the Congressional Budget Office will eventually attach more reasonable numbers, with more defensible assumptions, sparking an even more spectacular political blowback than the one that greeted Friday’s announcement. Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn’t necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren’s plan would actually cost.”<br/><strong>Megan McArdle, Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cow-cuddling-is-apparently-a-thing-now-2018-5" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">'Cow cuddling' is apparently a thing now</a>.<br><strong>Business Insider</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
