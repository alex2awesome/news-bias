Background checks take an average of 108 seconds. If someone is going through a suicidal episode or is a domestic abuser without a record, they could get a gun very quickly and harm themselves or others. With licensing, that person would be delayed and possibly deterred from getting a gun…<br/><br/>“When Connecticut established a licensing law in 1995, it was associated with a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent drop in gun suicides. Missouri had a licensing law for decades but repealed it in 2007. That change was associated with a 17 to 27 percent increase in gun homicides and a 16 percent increase in gun suicides. Background checks are supposed to stop bad people from getting guns, but they often don’t. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=9cd8b56c80&amp;e=4c7e142432">Licensing picks up that slack</a>.”<br/><strong>Madeline Marshall, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>At the MSNBC forum on Wednesday, “[Cory Booker] pointed out that in states with stronger gun laws, most of the firearms used in crimes come from states with much weaker laws. In 2017, half of guns traced by police in Boston had out-of-state origins… The same trend — or worse — has been found elsewhere, from Chicago to New York to Mexico… ‘We’ve created a system where you’re only as safe as the state near you with the least restrictive gun laws’… <br/><br/>“The biggest divide at the forum came when Democrats discussed mandatory buyback programs… A mandatory buyback program in Australia, paired with a ban on automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, was linked to drops in homicides and suicides. But even if a mandatory buyback for assault weapons were implemented in the US, it’s not clear that it would do much to reduce gun violence. Shootings with rifles, including assault rifles, make up less than 3 percent of gun homicides in the US. More than 70 percent of gun homicides are instead carried out with handguns… Still, there is some evidence that restricting access to assault weapons might reduce the lethality of mass shootings. For now, though, <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=625ccdad1d&amp;e=4c7e142432">Democrats are deeply divided on the issue</a>.”<br/><strong>German Lopez, Vox</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Some Democrats—who for years had assured voters that no one wants to confiscate their weapons—worried that [Beto O’Rourke’s recent comments about mandatory buybacks] had gone too far… But according to some veterans of past legislative fights over background checks, <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=dbb28efc8b&amp;e=4c7e142432">unapologetic attempts to push the gun control envelope are exactly what is needed</a>… ‘Nobody who ever got half a loaf asked for half a loaf’… ‘If we really wanted universal background checks, we’d be talking about an assault weapons ban. If we really wanted an assault weapons ban, we would be talking about a constitutional amendment.’”<br/><strong>Kara Voght, Mother Jones</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The White House and Congress have made clear that 40,000 deaths [from gun homicide and suicide] each year — roughly 100 fatal shootings every day — doesn’t strike them as a national emergency or something particularly worthy of their time… [But] 83 percent of adults support universal background checks. 72 percent of adults support ‘red flag’ laws. 72 percent of adults support gun licensing. 57 percent of adults support banning semi-automatic assault rifles… <br/><br/>“The cynical view on gun reform is that little progress has been made. But there is a real silver lining: The battle for the hearts and minds of voters has already been won… <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=24716dd34c&amp;e=4c7e142432">What’s stopping reform isn’t public will, it’s the politicians who stand in the way of reform</a>.”<br/><strong>Emma González and Tyah-Amoy Roberts, NBC News</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Critics note that “almost every candidate who spoke [at the forum] has promised some kind of executive action to bolster gun control… The popularity of executive action in both parties began growing years ago, analysts say, driven by a growing tension between voters demanding dramatic change and a Congress increasingly paralyzed by partisanship and polarization… Presidents often say they’re being forced to act because of Congress’s paralysis. As the Senate and House have become more polarized, they have struggled to enact major bills — prompting presidential edicts on issues such as immigration and health care. The result can be a whiplash, where each new president enacts sweeping policies only to have them abruptly reversed when the opposition takes over… <br/><br/>“Many Democrats consider the Trump presidency a crisis that requires an emergency response, and they’ve been frustrated as the president uses his powers to do things such as transfer funds to build a U.S.-Mexico border barrier or enact rules aimed at weakening the Affordable Care Act… The Democrats’ policies would not amplify presidential power to the extent that Trump has sought to, but they do reflect <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=38281ed5cd&amp;e=4c7e142432">a more president-centric approach to governing</a>, a feature that’s become central to Trump’s tenure.”<br/><strong>Chelsea Janes, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial.

Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”<br/><strong>Noah Feldman, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

The reason is that no sane gun owner will want his or her name on a gun registry after listening to this year&#x27;s Democratic candidates on the trail… specific Democrats, Beto O&#x27;Rourke especially, have clarified and confirmed the real reason for creating such registries. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=6c33478d8a&amp;e=4c7e142432">A gun registry is the precursor to a mass gun confiscation</a>. Gun owners are not paranoid for taking Democrats&#x27; promises literally on this topic… Gun violence in the U.S. is a small and ever-diminishing problem, but the media give the opposite impression. Last year, according to the FBI, there were approximately 10,265 gun murders in the U.S., down 6% year over year.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=c1207b5110&amp;e=4c7e142432">Biden is trying to have it both ways</a>.

It took the Canadian government six years to implement the 1995 legislation with fewer than 2 million gun owners signing up for licenses as of 2001. Worse yet, the [Canadian police] later reported error rates of 43 to 90 percent in firearm applications and registry information… 4,438 stolen firearms were successfully reregistered without alerting authorities. Despite the promises of Allan Rock, then the justice minister, that the firearms program would cost only C$2 million, the cumulative total had ballooned to more than C$2.7 billion by 2012 — the year the registry was discontinued.”<br/><strong>Vincent Harinam &amp; Gary Mauser, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Biden’s plan also “contains provisions that would bankrupt gun manufacturers for the crime of selling fully functional, legal firearms. It would ban the sale of the most popular rifles in America and the standard-capacity magazines made for America’s most commonly used handguns… If a terrorist uses an SUV in a ramming attack or puts a bomb in a van, it’s not the automaker’s fault. Why should it be the gun-maker’s fault [if] an evil man uses a lawful product unlawfully?... <br/><br/>“Let’s be clear — what the Biden plan calls ‘weapons of war’ are <em>not</em> the weapons that our soldiers carry into combat.

ARs have, of course, been used in a number of high-profile attacks, but they are not the most common guns used in mass shootings, and some of the worst attacks we’ve seen have been perpetrated with handguns and shotguns, making it questionable at best that confiscating them would prevent mass shootings… <br/><br/>“[Furthermore] New Zealand is halfway through its gun confiscation effort, which is supported by nearly every politician in the country, and its government has seized under 20,000 firearms. That’s a compliance rate of just 10%, according to the New Zealand Herald. A similar compliance rate in the U.S. would leave more than 14 million ARs and AKs in circulation…  [And] It’s fanciful to think a country with [Americans’] ingrained commitment to guns would accept a confiscation scheme when New Zealand, a place where such a scheme was passed with near-unanimous support, is having trouble implementing it.”<br/><strong>Stephen Gutowski, Washington Examiner</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Some point out that “The only reason that there was any discussion of an expanded background check bill standing a chance was that Trump was talking about approving it.

The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=9451e7999d&amp;e=4c7e142432" target="_blank">Nine-year-old enters 5km race ... and accidentally wins 10km [adult] event</a>.<br/><strong>The Guardian</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
