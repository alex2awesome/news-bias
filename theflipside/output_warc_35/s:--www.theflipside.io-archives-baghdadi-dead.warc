Also, the Trump administration did away with the self-imposed limits the Obama team had put on military action in Syria… Trump&#x27;s campaign against ISIS is one of the unalloyed foreign policy successes of his presidency.”<br/><strong>Peter Bergen, CNN</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Although his praise for allies in general is well-deserved, Trump, of course, gave Russia top billing—’Russia was great’—as well as Turkey, although both have proven fitful allies against the Islamic State and it seems their role here was limited to allowing the United States to fly over territory they controlled without shooting at U.S. troops. However, the Washington Post reported that the United States’s recently abandoned Kurdish allies played a key role, as did Iraq, with both providing intelligence and other assistance… I sincerely hope the president is right that Moscow and Ankara are now close counterterrorism partners and will play a major role in fighting the Islamic State.

And for every Baghdadi, there are many more ISIS fighters either on the loose or in precarious states of detention who could regroup as a result of the U.S. retreat from the battlefield.”<br/><strong>Uri Friedman, The Atlantic</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the impact of bad governance… For many Iraqi Sunni villagers under ISIS control, ISIS was just less bad than the brutality and discrimination they experienced under Iraq’s pro-Iranian Shiite-led government back then… ‘Nothing feeds extremism more than the in-your-face corruption and injustice’ that some of America’s closest Middle East allies administer daily to their people… <br/><br/>“[Trump] is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called ‘my favorite dictator,’ is not only rounding up violent Jihadists but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians. Their only crime is that they want to have a say in their country’s future and help to create an environment where they can realize their full potential… When Trump praises Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sisi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place.<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=da025237b2&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank"> We’re actually getting nowhere</a>.”<br/><strong>Thomas L.

At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

The Islamic State was in a bad way even before Washington took away its caliph, and it’s hard not to assume that Baghdadi’s removal will deal an even bigger blow to a group already hunkering down to save itself. ISIS’s leadership was prepared for the time when their so-called caliphate was burned to the ground, and their fighters have responded by transitioning into a classic insurgency… the United States has experienced this moment before: think Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006, Abu Ayyub Al-Masri in 2010 and Osama Bin Laden in 2011. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=868c2c3e65&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">Killing the top commander is highly unlikely to kill the group</a>.”<br/><strong>Daniel R.

That Baghdadi allowed his followers to enslave Yezidis and non-Muslims whom they captured also made real in contemporary society practices abandoned by most Muslims centuries ago. That he resurrected and legitimized such concepts will give them resonance for generations… to believe the forces which propelled him to power and infamy will dissipate with his death would be naïve. Trump has closed the chapter on the end of the beginning, but the next chapters in Baghdadi’s concept of the caliphate will play out for years, decades, and perhaps centuries to come.”<br/><strong>Michael Rubin, The National Interest</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>This “is a reminder that despite the craziness in Washington, life goes on as do other actions in government and the military besides impeachment.

Some are already complaining that President Trump said Baghdadi died like a dog whimpering and crying. I think that is a good thing and well said.

The death of Baghdadi is important as a matter of simple justice given his murderous history. And it informs other jihadists that they can achieve no victory and are likewise doomed to die in a tunnel or bomb blast. The raid also shows the importance of intelligence gathered from prisoners. Iraqi officials say their interrogation of captured ISIS fighters in recent months provided news about Baghdadi’s location… <br/><br/>“The Baghdadi raid [furthermore] underscores the anti-terrorist purpose of maintaining a U.S. military presence. The U.S. homeland hasn’t suffered a successful jihadist attack, foreign- planned or -inspired, in some time. This isn’t an accident. It’s the result of persistent security and intelligence work that coordinates with allies to pursue jihadists wherever they are around the world. In his better moments, Mr. Trump seems to understand this.
