For many Democrats, ObamaCare was a good first step, establishing the idea that the federal government has an important role to play in ensuring Americans have access to adequate insurance and care. But they also considered the law flawed — too reliant on profit-seeking private insurance companies, too derivative of Republican approaches to the issue, too much the result of the political compromises it took to get passed. For such activists, ObamaCare is the clunker they drive to work; Medicare-for-all — or something like it — is the shiny, sleek sports car they want to own someday.”<br><strong>Joel Mathis, The Week</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) said, let’s ‘keep what’s working’ in our current system. What does that mean? Today, millions of Americans remain uninsured or underinsured — with exorbitant deductibles and out-of-pocket costs on top of their ever-rising insurance premiums. Medical bankruptcy is common, even among the insured… And people with employer-sponsored private insurance? They lack health-care security. If they lose their job, they lose their insurance. <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/453504-medicare-for-all-a-voters-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">If ‘working’ means decent and reliable coverage, private health insurance is definitely not cutting it</a>…<br><br>“Beto O’Rourke said ‘Choice is fundamental’ as an argument to retain commercial insurance.

Kahn and Elliot Marseille, The Hill</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>While “[public] support drops dramatically… once you explain that [Medicare for All] would force them to swap their current insurance for a public plan… It is not entirely clear why this is the case, since few people really seem to be in love with their insurance company. Some surveys have found that enthusiasm for Medicare for All bounces back up if pollsters explain that, while private carriers would disappear, people would still be able to keep their doctors. That suggests some Americans are actually <a href="https://slate.com/business/2019/07/banning-private-insurance-democrats-health-care.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">worried about losing their favorite physician, not their Cigna card</a>.”<br><strong>Jordan Weissman, Slate</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“More than 100 rural hospitals across the nation have closed in recent years, leaving many poor communities bereft of access to even basic health-care services. From 2004 to 2014, some 650,000 women of childbearing age in rural counties lost all access to obstetric services… Meanwhile, even as some hospitals close, others are seeing rising profits, or embarking on aggressive capital expansions and acquisitions, propelled by fierce competition. Fancy new towers rise as rural hospitals fall, yet both have a common cause. The poverty of some of our hospitals and the rich fortunes of others are but two manifestations of a single pathology: a dysfunctional, profit-oriented system of hospital payment… <br><br>“How would things be different with Medicare for All? Well… there [would be] no hospital profits, and so profitability ceases to be the criterion that dictates which hospitals open or close, and which expand and beautify. It would remove the incentive for hospitals to chase lucrative service lines, like spinal surgery, at the expense of unprofitable ones, like mental health. And it would <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/hahnemann-hospital-medicare-for-all/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">ensure that we have hospitals, obstetric units, and mental health wards in the communities that need them</a>—not just where firms think that they will be profitable.”<br><strong>Adam Gaffney, The Nation</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p data-w-id="f4c90321-3c64-a306-8705-7e8e17532179">Regarding the Cadillac tax, “<a data-w-id="8348c036-bcb4-a6bb-d279-27cb7c4adbea" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-17/obamacare-s-cadillac-tax-needs-democratic-support" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">high-premium employer-based plans raise the cost of health care for everyone </a>by encouraging the overconsumption of expensive services.

They are an excise tax on medical devices like pacemakers and breast pumps, an excise tax on health insurance premiums, and a repeal of a ‘medicine cabinet tax’ on over-the-counter prescription medicines. These, too, should attract supermajorities in both chambers… <br><br>“[It’s worth noting that] the Cadillac Plan tax has never gone into effect, and was likely never going to go into effect. That should tell us something about the political feasibility of going after the employer-sponsored private sector health insurance benefit. If our ultimate goal is to make health insurance portable and flexible, we need to do it while accommodating the strong desire of most families to keep the insurance they like.”<br><strong>Ryan Ellis, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p><strong><em>Dated But Relevant:</em></strong> Some argue that “<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/406548-congress-must-not-delay-the-cadillac-tax-for-health-care" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the Cadillac tax helps correct a major flaw of the tax system</a>: the unlimited tax break for employer-provided health insurance. Although workers pay both income and payroll taxes on their cash wages, they are not taxed on their health benefits. That tax disparity creates an incentive for more of workers’ pay to be provided through health insurance rather than cash wages… If lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are serious about controlling health care costs and curbing misdirected tax breaks, the Cadillac tax, or a better designed replacement, should take effect as soon as possible.”<br><strong>Alan Viard, The Hill</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/new-adidas-and-arizona-tea-themed-sneaker-costs-99-cents-2019-7" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Adidas and Arizona Iced Tea have collaborated on a sneaker that costs only $0.99</a>.<br><strong>Insider</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
