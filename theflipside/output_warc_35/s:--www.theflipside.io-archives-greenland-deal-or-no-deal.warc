Nope</a> -- despite what Twitter might make you think. The United States has actually pursued the purchase of Greenland before… In 1946, US Secretary of State James Byrnes -- serving under President Harry Truman -- broached the idea with the Danish foreign minister at a United Nations meeting in New York. Nothing ever came of it. Almost 100 years before that, Secretary of State William Seward -- fresh off the US's purchase of Alaska -- apparently looked into buying Greenland from the Danes… <br><br>“Greenland is widely believed to be hugely rich in natural resources -- including iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium and oil. And much of it is currently untapped, due to the fact that, well, 80% of the country is covered by an ice sheet. But due to global warming, that ice sheet is melting rapidly… and that erosion of the ice sheet is expected to make the mining of Greenland's natural resources more doable.”<br><strong>Chris Cillizza, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“It makes perfect sense if you happen to share Trump’s indifference to environmental issues and indigenous rights. Greenland is believed to contain a lot of natural resource wealth that is difficult to exploit due to the large amounts of ice and permafrost in the way. But the planet is getting warmer. A vision of American public policy that is neither interested in halting the warming process nor concerned about the environmental impact of exploring the resources would naturally want to acquire such a potentially rich land… [This is] an example of how <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/16/20807928/donald-trump-buy-greenland-denmark" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">many wealthy and powerful people see climate change more as an opportunity for profit than a problem to solve</a>.”<br><strong>Matthew Yglesias, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Greenland is home to 56,000 people, and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/17/opinions/greenland-has-long-been-a-bargaining-chip-between-the-us-and-denmark-rosengaard/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the notion of buying an indigenous people and their ancestral lands smacks of colonialism</a> and is deeply problematic. Given how Trump's real estate projects worked out for the islanders of New York City — $360 million in forgiven or uncollected taxes with another $885 million in tax breaks going to luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings — it would be financially savvy for Denmark to steer clear of President Trump's crony capitalism.”<br><strong>Mikkel Rosengaard, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Many note that “private land ownership does not exist in Greenland… In 2017, a sheep farmer in southern Greenland told me how he had recently built a new pasture: After deciding that he wanted to expand, he told the local kommune, which posted a sign advertising the change publicly. When no one protested, he went ahead and did it. And forget opposing Medicare for All: In Greenland, the entire health-care industry is nationalized. Both medical care and prescription drugs are free… <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/trump-wants-buy-greenland-apparently/596263/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">President Trump will have to commit to supporting all those programs</a> if he hopes to add Greenland to the union.

It’s a wealthy country that runs a budget surplus. It can easily afford the annual subsidy of about $500 million that it pays to Greenland, and it sees itself as the island’s sensible steward rather than the unwilling owner of a vast, largely uninhabited territory. Besides, the 56,000 Greenlanders likely wouldn’t want to switch their allegiance… To protect U.S. interests in the Arctic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-16/trump-isn-t-crazy-to-want-to-buy-greenland" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Trump would be better off working closely and constructively with European allies</a>, including Denmark and Norway.

But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-25/trump-ukraine-call-transcript-has-impeachment-worthy-evidence?srnd=opinion">Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time</a>.

Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation.

Greenland holds no military value for a nation as small as Denmark, which has no need to worry itself with ‘force projection’ the way the U.S. does. And while the natural resources could be as valuable to Denmark as they would be to the U.S., Denmark right now spends nearly $600 million annually in subsidies to Greenland’s government. Ridding itself of those costs, plus getting a big lump-sump payment from its American allies to boot, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dont-laugh-trumps-idea-of-buying-greenland-isnt-entirely-wacky" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">could be a good deal for the Danes</a>.”<br><strong>Quin Hillyer, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“If it is true, it would be the mother of all deals for the deal maker.

Thule better allows the U.S. to warn its citizens of an imminent attack. And it does more than that. Thanks to Thule's deep water port and long runway, the base provides a logistics hub for operations in the Arctic. And it gives the U.S. military the means to deter and defeat prospective aggression… <br><br>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/buying-greenland-isnt-a-good-idea-its-a-great-idea" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">The purchase of Greenland would further strengthen these existing national security benefits</a>. Unbound from political sensitivities in Denmark, for example, the U.S. could station missile forces in Greenland, including intermediate range missile forces. Russia's Arctic ambitions would have to be put on ice… But this isn't just about American interests. Greenland's small population also has everything to gain from a massive influx of American investment. The surge in tourism alone would surely offer a vast untapped potential.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“As it happens, in my spare time I’ve been taking in a Danish drama called ‘Borgen’ (the name for their primary government building)... one episode concerned Greenland and a pending visit to Denmark of the President of the United States! Denmark’s first woman prime minister (a moderate liberal and the star of the show) makes a visit to Greenland, where she hears a litany of complaints about how the mostly indigenous population of the icebound island is condescended to by Denmark, deprived of their autonomy, starved for adequate resources, etc. Hmmm. I suspect this plot line has a large element of truth to it. Denmark says it is not for sale, and it is not clear just who does have the sovereign right to decide the matter. <a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/08/yes-to-acquiring-greenland.php" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Perhaps the inhabitants of Greenland might like to be acquired by the United States?</a>Might be interesting to ask them.”<br><strong>Steven Hayward, Power Line Blog</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“The reason to want total dominion over Greenland is to gain the power to exclude: China is verrrry interested in the island as an Atlantic base that would put it on America’s (and Europe’s) doorstep.
