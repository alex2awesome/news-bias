But that’s small comfort for immigrants and their families living in a climate of fear under President Trump. Bureau officials have for decades recognized that communities with significant immigrant populations are likely to be undercounted if there is a citizenship question on the census… <br><br>“By the bureau’s own, nonpartisan analysis, adding a citizenship question to the ‘short form’ that will go to every household in America in 2020 could result in an undercount of 6.5 million people — close to the entire population of Indiana or Tennessee. And the agency has told Mr. Ross that there are better alternatives to a citizenship question that wouldn’t pose significant ‘potential quality and cost disruptions’ in administering the census, such as deriving citizenship data from the American Community Survey… At the heart of the dispute lies the question: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/opinion/sunday/census-citizenship-question-immigrants.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Who gets to be counted?</a>”<br><strong>Editorial Board, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“In 2016, a poll of voters in key battleground states found that 76 percent of voters agreed with the following statement: ‘However we feel about abortion, politicians should not be allowed to deny a woman’s health coverage for it just because she’s poor.’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-bidens-support-of-the-hyde-amendment-makes-him-unfit-to-lead/2019/06/05/b78f025c-87bf-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html?utm_term=.9fe87b6330ae" target="_blank">Sixty-two percent agreed</a>that ‘when Medicaid covers pregnancy care but withholds coverage for abortion, we’re taking away a low-income woman’s ability to make important personal decisions based on what is best for her circumstances. ’ And a recent poll commissioned by a consortium of women’s health groups found that 9 in 10 women of color believe ‘that a woman being able to control if, when, and how to have children provides both individual and societal benefits.’ If Joe Biden wants to carry the banner of a party that claims to champion, protect and uphold the inalienable rights of black, brown and poor people, he must reverse his support of the Hyde Amendment and follow the lead of his fellow Democratic candidates.”<br/><strong>Danielle Campoamor, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Critics of the candidate argue, “Want to defeat Trump?

But challenging Biden’s record is important. For example, his core base of support – older Democrats – needs to know what an unreliable defender of Social Security and Medicare he is. By challenging him on his record, especially in the eyes of older, traditional Democratic voters, progressives could break the myth of Biden’s ‘electability’.

Consider this: In states with large numbers of noncitizens such as Texas, New York, and California, some state legislative districts may have twice as many eligible voters as adjoining ones. This means districts with fewer citizens have more electoral power than the districts with more citizens. That isn’t fair… <br><br>“Equalizing districts by the number of citizens prevents some voters from having their votes over-weighted and over-valued, while others are under-weighted and under-valued. If one-person, one-vote — one of our most enduring egalitarian principles — has any meaning, the citizen population gaps in voting districts must not be so glaringly wide. Without census data that includes citizenship status, it is probably not possible for states and smaller jurisdictions to draw election districts that equalize eligible voters.”<br><strong>Edward Blum, American Enterprise Institute</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“It is worth noting that <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/380982-stop-ginning-up-hysteria-citizenship-question-on-census-is-nothing-new" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the citizenship question does not ask about a person’s legal status</a>; it merely asks about citizenship status and thus has nothing whatsoever to do with immigration enforcement. In fact, federal law prevents census data from being used for anything other than statistical analysis. That is the law and there is no evidence any agency intends to violate it… If there is a legitimate fear at all, it is that media hype may create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In its 2017 ‘Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses,’ <a href="https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/symposium-only-america" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the U.N. recommends that member countries ask census questions identifying both an individual’s country of birth and country of citizenship</a>. A Commerce Department memorandum on this subject dated March 26, 2018, notes that countries asking a citizenship question on their census include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom.”<br><strong>Hans A. von Spakovsky, Heritage Foundation</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“If Joe Biden can win his way through the primaries, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-generate-very-different-emotional-responses-from-republicans/" target="_blank">he’s almost lab-engineered to beat Trump</a>. He doesn’t cause Republican panic, he has the potential to connect with white working-class voters in a way that Hillary couldn’t in 2016, and he has a potential to connect better with black voters than Hillary did… if Biden emerges from [this] crucible, Trump will face a very different challenge than he faced in 2016.”<br/><strong>David French, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="column-60 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div><div class="column-61 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-7 w-clearfix"><div id="w-node-c9ca80732245-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide center w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div id="w-node-c9ca80732246-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide libertarian w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p><strong>A libertarian&#x27;s take</strong></p><p>“The relevant question is not the nationality of a source offering ‘oppo research’ but <a href="https://reason.com/2019/06/13/is-accepting-information-about-a-political-opponent-from-a-foreigner-an-assault-on-our-democracy/" target="_blank">the accuracy and relevance of the information</a>. Another consideration is whether the information was obtained illegally—by hacking emails, for example. While the Supreme Court has said people have a First Amendment right to share illegally obtained information if they were not involved in the lawbreaking (something that news organizations frequently do), you might reasonably argue that they should also report such crimes when they become aware of them, which may be what Trump had in mind when he said he might contact the FBI ‘if I thought there was something wrong.’”<br/><strong>Jacob Sullum, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p data-w-id="d971e3c9-ad34-cfb4-704d-2fd8489bc1b3">You can now have an official <a data-w-id="427a3b13-24af-8908-676f-7a76f622367d" href="https://www.insider.com/official-pokmon-wedding-japan-2019-5" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Pokémon-themed wedding in Japan with Pikachu mascots</a>. </p><p data-w-id="1921ae3b-56fa-90d9-036b-be5883e6992b">‍<strong data-w-id="26ecf082-6e33-c979-4a3c-6f08d095ccfd">Insider</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
