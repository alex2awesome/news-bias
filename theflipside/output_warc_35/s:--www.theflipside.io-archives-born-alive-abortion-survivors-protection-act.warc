For instance, a condition called pre-eclampsia, involving high blood pressure and other problems, can kill both mother and fetus, and in most cases the only treatment is to deliver the baby. If it seems unlikely that the baby will survive, the family may choose to provide just comfort care — wrapping and cuddling the baby — and allow the child to die naturally without extreme attempts at resuscitation.”<br><strong>Denise Grady, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Having a child born to die on his or her birthday is a unique tragedy.

In 2002, Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which guaranteed to infants born at any stage of development full legal rights. That bill, which passed with bipartisan support, did not include criminal penalties for doctors and did not impose specific requirements on medical care.” According to a board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, this bill “is a stark departure from the 2002 law as it singles out abortion and applies strict new requirements on abortion providers only, with the intent to malign and threaten abortion providers.”<br><strong>Anna North, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/senators-anti-abortion-bill-manufactured-infanticide-controversy-fdc9f9d1bca8/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Sasse is capitalizing on a manufactured controversy</a> over a New York bill recently signed into law… In so doing, he mischaracterizes the bill, saying in his press release that it ‘repealed protections… for an infant born alive during an abortion.’ In reality, New York lawmakers removed abortion from the criminal code, as the state had decided to criminalize the medical procedure before the historic Supreme Court decision in 1973. Lawmakers also created a new section within public health law, solidifying the right to abortion up 24 weeks and access thereafter strictly in cases of fetal non-viability and to preserve the health or life of the pregnant person.”<br><strong>Amanda Michelle Gomez, ThinkProgress</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The move is part of a larger strategy designed to maintain current abortion restrictions while <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/senate-defeats-anti-abortion-bill-1185531" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">revving up the GOP’s conservative base ahead of 2020</a> and courting independents who may be turned off by [the] Democrats' position on abortion rights… <br><br>Sen.

At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.
