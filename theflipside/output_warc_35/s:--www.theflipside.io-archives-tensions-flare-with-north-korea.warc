It has shown in the past that it is perfectly willing to wait out difficult US Presidents and wait for a change in leadership that will give it a chance to restart negotiations and earn more time to shore up its military capabilities… While many analysts have observed that North Korea had potentially the best US President it was going to get in Trump, due to his willingness to break with tradition and desire to make an historic deal, Pyongyang may feel that it has struck out and is better off trying President number 46.”<br><strong>James Griffiths, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p data-w-id="f1d57729-491d-a039-51d0-ae741046dacc">“The president has no obvious interest in national security and foreign affairs, except insofar as such things affect him personally.
