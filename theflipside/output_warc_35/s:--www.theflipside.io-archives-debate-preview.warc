Nearly all the Democrats have put up plans that would pay farmers to capture carbon in the soil by converting corn acres to conservation acres. Even the Farm Bureau likes the idea. The candidates are changing the conversation rapidly around agriculture and extreme weather, as the corn got planted six weeks late this year amid epic flooding. Trade wars that pummeled commodity markets have Iowans rethinking their commitment to export markets, and that perhaps we are growing too much corn, and that we can’t sustain this petrochemical model for much longer. It’s a remarkable thing to hear.”<br><strong>Art Cullen, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some also note that “a rising China presents the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/how-will-democrats-deal-china/594817/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">stiffest challenge to American global supremacy since the fall of the Soviet Union</a>. The unraveling U.S.-China relationship could touch nearly every aspect of American life, from the future of U.S. industry and the global influence of Silicon Valley to our military priorities and diplomatic alliances… The 2020 campaign offers a chance to forge a consensus on how Washington can contend with Chinese power.”<br><strong>MiIchael Schuman, The Atlantic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Harris’s plan, “Harris has clarified her stance on health care. But <a href="https://slate.com/business/2019/07/kamala-harris-health-care-medicare-private-insurance.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">you have to wonder how committed she really is to it</a>… It’s kind of refreshing to see a presidential campaign implicitly admit that it’s just playing with numbers that only a few budget nerds will care about. And there’s obviously some lol-nothing-matters political logic to it; the chances of Congress ever passing something as ambitious as full-on ‘Medicare for All,’ or even a modified version like what Harris is pitching, are slim. So what’s the point of committing yourself to the unpopular tax hikes that are probably necessary to make such a bill a reality? Impressing policy reporters doesn’t get you that far in the Iowa caucuses, after all.”<br><strong>Jordan Weissmann, Slate</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Meanwhile, there's a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/28/jay-inslee-2020-climate-change-health-care-1437877" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">2020 Dem who may actually know how to fix health care</a>… [Jay Inslee] created both the nation’s first public option and universal long-term care benefit — albeit a limited one — has run a successful Obamacare market, and expanded reproductive rights.

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”<br/><strong>Kyle Smith, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/us/halloween-date-petition-trnd/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">A petition to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October</a> nears 100,000 signatures.<br><strong>CNN</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
