But it also<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/opinion/barr-mueller-letter.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">shows that Mr. Mueller sensed the urgency of his conclusions</a> — and that he couldn’t sit idly by as the chief legal officer of the United States actively undermined them.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Barr's Senate testimony on Wednesday was a master class in obfuscation, backtracking and blame-shifting… When asked how a political campaign should react if approached by a foreign national offering dirt, Barr didn't give the only correct and sensible answer -- ‘run and call the FBI’ -- but instead twisted himself in a pretzel, saying the person should first try to ascertain if the foreigner is an intel agent. And <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/opinions/william-barr-master-class-backtracking-honig/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Barr pretended not to understand what basic words such as ‘receptive’ and ‘suggest’ mean</a>, when Democrats had the nerve to use such ‘technical’ terms.”<br><strong>Elie Honig, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“There was a tortured exchange about the fact that, as Mueller details, Trump instructed then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn to have Mueller fired, and then when that was reported in the press, instructed McGahn to deny it publicly. The report even describes Trump insisting to McGahn that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/01/william-barrs-congressional-testimony-was-shameful/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a76dacdbee29" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">because he had not used the word ‘fire,’ that meant he didn’t really tell McGahn to have Mueller fired</a>, and that meant McGahn could publicly insist that Trump never told him to have Mueller fired.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) later said about a separate matter, ‘That’s some masterful hairsplitting.’”<br><strong>Paul Waldman, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding the larger question of the attorney general’s powers over special counsel investigations, some note that “the special counsel regulations [were] produced in 1999 by Janet Reno’s Department of Justice under Bill Clinton’s administration… For the drafters of the special counsel regulations then, the goal was to create a mechanism that would still allow investigation of the president, but would prevent future Starrs from going on what the Clinton administration perceived as witch hunts against future presidents. Putting the special counsel under the supervision of the attorney general was the centerpiece of the strategy… <br><br>“Somehow, in the course of building up trust in Mueller over the last two years, many Democrats conveniently forgot that the regulations drafted by Democrats would allow the attorney general to minimize or even subvert Mueller’s findings… <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-01/barr-twisted-mueller-report-because-special-counsel-rules-let-him?srnd=premium" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Blame the regulations for Barr’s distortions — and fix them</a>.

Is it that they lost a precious 25 days — from March 24 to April 18 — to spin Mueller’s findings to their liking?… [Since Trump won the 2016 election, the narrative] that he might be a Russian asset or may have conspired with Russia has been a near article of faith for the resistance. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-01/william-barr-testimony-why-are-the-democrats-so-angry" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">If Democrats can chastise Barr for spinning Mueller’s report for 24 days, then why can’t Republicans ask why Mueller didn’t end all the speculation</a>about a Trump-Russia conspiracy as soon as he found out it wasn’t true?”<br><strong>Eli Lake, Bloomberg</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“The Democrats’ perjury/contempt/impeachment slander against Barr is based on the fact that, in prior congressional testimony, Barr was asked whether Mueller agreed with Barr’s conclusions about the report, including that there was insufficient evidence to charge obstruction. Barr replied that he did not know whether Mueller agreed. Democrats now contend that Barr must have known Mueller disagreed because he had Mueller’s letter. But <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andrew-mccarthy-mueller-letter-barr-report-washington-post" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Mueller’s letter doesn’t say he disagreed with Barr’s conclusion</a>… Mueller’s complaint is that Barr ‘did not fully capture the context’ of Mueller’s magnum opus – the ‘nature and substance’ of the report… <br><br>“Parsed carefully (which you have to do with the special counsel’s Jesuitical work), Mueller is precisely not saying that Barr misrepresented his key findings. He is saying that he and the Clinton/Obama minions he recruited to staff the case wrote the report with a certain mood music in mind. To their chagrin, Barr gave us just the no-crime bottom line.”<br><strong>Andrew McCarthy, Fox News</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Read the supposedly damning exchange with Sen Chris Van Hollen.<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bill-barr-didnt-lie-or-mislead/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Barr is never asked whether Mueller is unhappy with his letter, just whether he’s unhappy with his conclusions</a>, meaning his decision not to charge the president with obstruction… There’s another exchange with Rep . Charlie Crist that people are also focusing on. Barr is asked about anonymous officials from the Mueller probe telling the press they are unhappy with his summary letter. Barr, correctly, says he doesn’t know their discontents (he presumably didn’t talk to any of them about this, and wouldn’t know anyway since they were anonymous).”<br><strong>Rich Lowry, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Moreover, “Mr. Barr told the Senate Wednesday that he offered Mr. Mueller the chance to review his four-page letter before sending it to Congress, but the special counsel declined. Mr. Mueller worked for Mr. Barr, and that was the proper time to offer suggestions or disagree. Instead, Mr. Mueller ducked that responsibility and then griped in an ex-post-facto letter that was conveniently leaked on the eve of Mr. Barr’s testimony… <br><br>“<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-real-attorney-general-11556752279" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Democrats and the media are turning the AG into a villain for doing his duty and making the hard decisions that special counsel Robert Mueller abdicated</a>… This trashing of Bill Barr shows how frustrated and angry Democrats continue to be that the special counsel came up empty in his Russia collusion probe. He was supposed to be their fast-track to impeachment. Now they’re left trying to gin up an obstruction tale, but the probe wasn’t obstructed and there was no underlying crime. So they’re shouting and pounding the table against Bill Barr for acting like a real Attorney General.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Ultimately, both Attorney General Barr and Special Counsel Mueller have done the nation a service not just by clearing the President of collusion, but by returning the question of obstruction to Congress, where it belongs… Impeachment must be the only solution to Trump’s challenge to the constitutional order.
