But this assertion was never plausible, and will likely become less so once the prosecution’s file becomes public and the new prosecution of Epstein, by the Trump Department of Justice, proceeds. Another of Acosta’s defenses is that he was not personally responsible for the ‘terms of Epstein’s incarceration.’ He may not be responsible for how cushy Epstein had it during his time served, but <a data-w-id="735d9d8f-813c-b972-95ef-3e4b282e5ef1" href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/07/epstein-indictment-puts-spotlight-back-on-acosta.php" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">it was Acosta who negotiated the ridiculously short duration of the sentence</a>.”<br data-w-id="9e0ed480-52a6-c37d-c249-af10cdddef68"><strong data-w-id="ac047f9b-7eeb-cc98-0a69-60527f6c5462">Paul Mirengoff, Power Line Blog</strong><br data-w-id="3c5d427f-eee8-c773-7884-5fd5604ab0fe"><br data-w-id="a19f7311-db29-623d-949f-d797790c13a5">“It’s true that the public has a better understanding of the trauma of sexual abuse now than in 2008, in part because of the many people who have told their stories publicly as part of the #MeToo movement. But as CNN’s Kara Scannell has reported, Acosta’s office appears to have prosecuted other, less high-profile offenders than Epstein far more aggressively at around the same time, and obtained significant sentences for them that included prison time… No one is disputing that Jeffrey Epstein had extremely powerful lawyers who put pressure on victims and prosecutors alike. They were no doubt formidable adversaries.

And that’s not all. Reporter Vicky Ward, who’s been chasing this story for nearly 20 years, notes today at the Daily Beast that “federal prosecutors agreed to keep the [plea] deal secret from Epstein’s victims, which meant they would not know to challenge it in court.

It will take a network that’s just as substantial to uncover the extent of Epstein’s possible crimes. It’s perverse, but there’s a direct relationship between the magnitude of a system of abuse and the magnitude of the effort required to end it.

But the proper approach, obvious to many, was to show some contrition. He could have acknowledged his mistakes and apologized for them. He could have highlighted why others shouldn’t discount victims of sexual abuse in the future as he once did. He could have even resigned. Acosta chose another path.

At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

There they are, leading Hollywood liberals, leaping to their feet to cheer for a man who, at age 43, gave a 13-year-old girl Quaaludes for the purpose of having sex with her and sodomizing her. Polanski suffered in no significant way for his crime… <br><br>“The Jeffrey Epstein case should end a nearly 50-year era in which the mandarins of our cultures — the intellectuals, writers, and artists — almost unanimously ignored, laughed off, or even outright celebrated sexual exploitation of girls and very young women, even in many cases prepubescent ones… Epstein’s habits were so unremarkable that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were happy to be associated with him.

They were simply <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-roman-polanski-hollywood-sexual-exploitation/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">symptoms of a disease</a>.”<br><strong>Kyle Smith, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Acosta, some note that in 2005 “police brought the case to the local prosecutor, Barry Krischer, an elected Democratic official. But Krischer wasn’t interested in pursuing felony charges against Epstein, a well-known donor to political candidates (mostly Democrats)... When Krischer refused, [local police] took the case to federal law enforcement. Federal prosecutors, it is important to note, generally have no jurisdiction over sex crimes. But they agreed to investigate whether Epstein violated federal law by, among other things, using the facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls into prostitution… <br><br>“The U.S. Attorney’s Office determined that federal charges against Epstein might not stick. But they were able to leverage their investigation to extract a plea… While the punishment was inadequate to the crime, from all reports, the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-ignorant-trashing-of-alex-acosta" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">experienced, career prosecutors reporting to Acosta felt it was better than any alternative</a>.

Plea bargains guarantee efficiency: costly, time-consuming trials are avoided more often than not. But at what cost?…<br><br>“If anything, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/acostas-plea-deal-with-epstein-is-a-symptom-of-our-broken-justice-system" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Acosta is a symptom of a justice system that is broken and rotting from within</a>. He is not responsible for Epstein’s crimes, but he did facilitate a deal that resulted in a total lapse of accountability. President Trump must decide if this past failure requires Acosta’s resignation. And we must decide what to do about a criminal justice system that let a monster walk free.”<br><strong>Kaylee McGhee, Washington Examiner</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“On social media, lots of people seem to think that any revelations from this prosecution will be devastating to the party they oppose and avert their eyes from the possibility that Epstein could start talking about sordid and criminal behavior by prominent figures in their preferred party. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/jeffrey-epsteins-powerful-criminal-crew/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Investigate them all, name them all, indict them all, prosecute them all</a>.

In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
