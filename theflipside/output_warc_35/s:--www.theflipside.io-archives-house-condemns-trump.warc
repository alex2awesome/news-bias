His statements on Sunday and since then imply that immigrants are somehow less loyal to our country, less American, and that we should ‘go back’ or ‘leave’ if we disagree with him… The suspicion that immigrants are not to be trusted or are unpatriotic is not just wrong; it is un-American. And dangerous… <br><br>“The problem for the president is that many Americans are immigrants or have friends or family members who are immigrants. The American people continue to support newcomers. A Gallup poll last year found that 75 percent of Americans believe immigration is good for the country. The American people understand that what makes the nation great is not people’s bloodlines or how long ago their ancestors arrived here, but their character and belief in the Constitution.”<br><strong>Ted Lieu, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some argue, “a great number of Americans in both parties have little sympathy for the Squad, and for all kinds of reasons, ranging from simple racism, Islamophobia and misogyny, to genuine policy disagreements, to unhappiness with the bigotry and insensitivity that members of the Squad have themselves sometimes displayed. Almost everyone has a reason to temper their support. Professional Republicans are silent because they fear their voters; professional Democrats are still angry at the Squad for challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Many are inclined to declare a pox on both their houses… <br><br>“Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of equivocation. Trump has given us a binary choice: Either stand with American principles, which in this case means standing in defense of the Squad, or equivocate, which means standing with Trump and white nationalism… Our nation won’t be undermined by anything the Squad has said or done. It will be undermined if we don’t <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-are-all-the-squad-now/2019/07/16/e319ffe8-a7eb-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4dc274b1e5de" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">fight back against this assault on our universal principles</a>. Disagree with the Squad, refute them, argue with them, vote against them. But also defend them.”<br><strong>Robert Kagan, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Others counter, “A politician accused of anti-Semitism. Someone who has been critical of the United States and its leaders, often in strong terms. Who advocates positions outside the American mainstream. Who swears. These characteristics, President Trump argues, are ones that contribute to his labeling Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and several of her colleagues as ‘anti-USA,’ as he did Tuesday morning. They are also characteristics that describe Trump… <br><br>“Omar has, in fact, been critical of U.S. politics. Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported on her unique approach to the country’s politics and culture, noting that she has offered criticism of her adopted country, which ‘had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her’… [But] <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/16/what-has-ilhan-omar-done-that-donald-trump-hasnt/?utm_term=.575387a1a77d" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Trump has his own track record of much more direct criticism of the United States</a>. While Barack Obama was president, Trump declared that political correctness had led the United States to lose ‘all sense of direction or purpose.’ That ‘our country and our ‘leaders’ are getting dumber all the time.’ That the country had become ‘stupid.’ That the country had never looked ‘weaker or more pathetic’... What has Ilhan Omar done that Donald Trump hasn’t?”<br><strong>Philip Bump, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“James Baldwin famously said, ‘I love America more than any other country in this world, and exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.’ As immigrants, we often come to America because we love it more than the place we are leaving… We come to make a better life for ourselves, certainly, but also because we believe in the idea of America. Our optimism about what this nation can be is not naive, it's aspirational and visionary. Among our masses lies the same fervor that our founding fathers brought here: a fervor for a democracy that represents our interests. When we run for office, the potential we have to make government work for all of us is one that true Americans welcome. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/opinions/trump-twitter-congresswomen-attack-opinion-bhojwani/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Trump is afraid that we do not huddle in fear but stride in power</a>.”<br><strong>Sayu Bhojwani, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

This couldn’t be clearer. There are other ‘minority lawmakers’ who oppose Trump’s policies. He did not suggest, and has never suggested, that they leave America… <br><br>“Trump’s statement isn’t from the anti-immigrant playbook. <a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/07/the-washington-post-pounces-mindlessly.php" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It’s from the ‘America, love it or leave it’ playbook</a>.

We know it when we see it.”<br><strong>David Marcus, The Federalist</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Words matter. Especially emotionally loaded words such as ‘racist.’ That’s why it is so frustrating to see President Trump’s awful, inexcusable tweets telling Democratic congresswomen to ‘go back’ to other countries mischaracterized as racist. Race and nationality are not the same thing. Race and ethnicity are not even the same thing. Race and religion are far from synonymous. Likewise, racism is not the same thing as xenophobia, or as nativism, or as bigotry. Racism is a form of bigotry, but not all bigotry is racism… <br><br>“When words are over-used or misused, they lose their power. That’s why we all learn the story of the boy who cried wolf. If ‘racism’ is used to refer to everything that is seen as bad and as seen as having anything to do with ‘other-ness,’ people start tuning it out. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beyond-racism-lets-get-language-right" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Because it is used to mean so many things, it begins to mean nothing</a>. Its horribleness then becomes more difficult, not less, to recognize and counteract. Trump’s tweets were wrong because they were nativist and arguably bigoted. To say that is to say enough.”<br><strong>Quin Hillyer, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Some, however, contend that Trump’s “commentary calls to mind the same kinds of dark, xenophobic, hatred that has greeted new Americans since there were new Americans, and, while it certainly continues to this day, it isn’t a sentiment most Americans are used to hearing from their President… The story of America is written in the blood, sweat, tears and – certainly – perspectives, opinions, and hard work of immigrants. We are a nation where anyone can become an American, and on becoming so is held in the same standing as any other. When we disparage immigrants – or our political enemies, or both – as less than their fellow Americans, we do a <a href="https://theresurgent.com/2019/07/16/trumps-comments-are-racist-republicans-should-say-so/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">disservice to the very idea of America, and the ideals that make our country great</a>.” <br><strong>Drew Holden, The Resurgent</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“On Sunday, Donald Trump gave the Democrats a gift… On Monday, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-squad-gives-a-gift-to-donald-trump/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the four congresswomen handed Trump a gift in return</a>, managing to respond to the president’s insults in some of the most politically self-destructive ways possible… <br><br>“First, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota again called for impeaching President Trump during the press conference with the members of the “Squad” yesterday afternoon. The latest NBC News poll finds that just 21 percent of registered voters want the House to begin impeachment proceedings… Second, Omar also contended Trump ‘has been credibly accused of committing multiple crimes, including colluding with a foreign government to interfere with our election.’ Did she miss the entire Mueller report? Or does she think that Trump did collude and that over 22 months, Robert Mueller and his whole team of investigators and prosecutors just missed the evidence?”<br><strong>Jim Geraghty, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Since even before Pelosi took back the speaker’s gavel in 2018, she has been begging her Democratic colleagues to drop the impeachment fantasy. She has been clear about this since Trump's inauguration, saying over and over again that it is not the strategy to pursue, especially as the 2020 elections are just around the corner. Yet Omar and Tlaib called for it anyway on national television, stoking the fire of impeachment and challenging fellow Democrats to get behind an issue that Pelosi has explicitly instructed the caucus to drop…<br><br>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-take-a-pass-on-unity-go-back-to-infighting-after-trumps-tweets" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It is astonishing to see they did not band together for at least 48 hours</a>, taking full advantage of the political win Trump handed them. One would think that they would have rallied together, putting their strategic and personal differences aside long enough to refocus their attention and energy on a common enemy.”<br><strong>Becket Adams, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/02/17/this-kid-makes-shelter-puppies-look-fabulous/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">This kid makes shelter puppies look fabulous</a>.<br><strong>New York Post</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
