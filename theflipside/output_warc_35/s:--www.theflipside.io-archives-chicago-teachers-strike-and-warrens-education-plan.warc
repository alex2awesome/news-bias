It’s known as ‘bargaining for the common good’… teachers are feeling confident that they can get what they want, and they have reason to.”<br/><strong>Alexia Fernández Campbell, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Critics on the school board and in mainstream media have responded with the common refrain that Chicago is broke and can’t afford such demands. But Chicago is awash in wealth – enough for Lightfoot to approve the giveaway of $1.3bn [over 23 years] in public money to luxury real estate firm Sterling Bay for the mega-development project Lincoln Yards. CTU has long argued that the way to pay for their demands is clear: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/19/cdhicago-teachers-strike-neoliberalism">end these corporate giveaways and tax the rich</a>.”<br/><strong>Miles Kampf-Lassin and Micah Uetricht, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some argue that “although Lightfoot likes to point out she’s ‘not Rahm,’ she’s actually retained the same chief contract negotiator as Rahm and many mayors before him… According to members of the union’s negotiating team, [his] style is to try to force victory for his side by holding back on serious settlement options till the very last minute. His strategy, repeated over many contracts, is to force a narrowing of the subjects that will get addressed by the educators, and then, with hours to go to a strike deadline, suddenly make a ‘take it or leave it,’ offer… <br/><br/>“Perhaps the most important lesson Chicago’s educators have taught us is that to build a country where policy makers favor the supermajority rather than the 1 percent means a return to massive, supermajority strikes. It is only through such strikes that we can rebuild the solidarity desperately needed among workers—and between workers and the broader society. <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/union-strike-chicago-teachers/">Strikes are to democracy what water is to life</a>: not a distraction or a disturbance but the foundation.”<br/><strong>Jane McAlevey, The Nation</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Warren’s plan, “our current school funding system is one where states and local communities provide the lion’s share of funding, with the federal government chipping in only about 10 percent of the money. The other 90% of school funding is overly reliant on property taxes, where communities with wealthy households with higher property values end up with more revenue for schools. This often leaves poor neighborhoods with poor schools… [Warren] importantly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesleywhistle/2019/10/21/how-elizabeth-warren-would-better-fund-our-schools/#88bf00b1e8a6">shows how linking school funding to property values continues the effects of racist housing policies</a>, like redlining, making students of color disproportionately likely to attend under-funded schools… Warren would funnel an additional $450 billion into low-income schools over the next 10 years. She also committed to improve the funding formula to ensure the money goes to the students and schools with the most need and requiring states to chip in more and adopt progressive formulas.”<br/><strong>Wesley Whistle, Forbes</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The crux of Warren’s new plan is a commitment to expand federal funding of public K-12 education. But the plan also recognizes that the federal government ultimately controls a very small portion of the overall funding going to schools… <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/10/22/20924725/elizabeth-warren-chicago-teachers-strike-k-12-education-plan">Warren is trying to turn the federal money into a carrot to get states to invest more of their own money</a>; states that adopt progressive funding formulas and keep their promises for allocating money consistently would get the additional [federal] money.”<br/><strong>Ella Nilsen, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Critics note that “Just saying teacher salaries should increase is a sound bite for applause and social media reactions, but sorely misses how deeply felt and broadly damaging the teacher pay problem is. American teachers are making 4.5% less than they were 10 years ago and have seen a $30 decrease in weekly pay compared to the $124 raise given to other American college graduates… As a Democrat in 2019-20, you are not immune to teacher criticism and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakringelstein/2019/10/22/the-problem-with-warrens-education-plan/#5ffbb4d310ce">must be more specific when addressing the biggest ‘structural change’ needed in education</a>, teacher pay.”<br/><strong>Zak Ringelstein, Forbes</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

The union backed Lightfoot’s opponent Toni Preckwinkle for mayor of Chicago, donating nearly $300,000 to her campaign in 2019. But Lightfoot won, throwing the union’s plans into turmoil… union demands don’t stop at the school district level. The union’s offer also dictates what legislative efforts the school district should support, and it mandates that the school district ‘ensure’ the city uses certain funds for affordable housing units.”<br/><strong>Mailee Smith, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“As Chicago teachers marched into Week Two of their strike Monday, Chicago Teachers Union leaders pursued their strategy of moving the goal posts. One indicator: Contract demands that started with pay now include rent control… <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-teacher-strike-chicago-lori-lightfoot-20191021-s4xhtmqsn5bihny4b3eow6fvxe-story.html">Rent control policy has no place in a teacher contract negotiation</a>. Nor does affordability of housing. Nor does presidential politics. But in the spaghetti-throwing exercise CTU has employed for months, issues that fall outside the parameters of a labor agreement keep getting tossed at the wall.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, Chicago Tribune</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Despite the common narrative that teachers are underpaid, this is clearly not the case in Chicago. According to USA Today, ‘Chicago teachers on average earn nearly $79,000, and even a second-year teacher earns nearly $54,000.’ Imagine that, earning well over <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/in-chicago-teachers-union-strike-students-suffer-due-to-educators-greed">150% of the national median personal income in just your second year out of school</a>. Those aren’t exactly starvation wages, especially for a job that only takes up 10 months out of the year. Oh, and the president of the national teachers&#x27; union, Randi Weingarten? She makes nearly $600,000 in annual salary. The Chicago Teachers Union’s greed is even more apparent when you consider that they’ve rejected the district’s offer of a 16% raise over five years, demanding even more.”<br/><strong>Brad Polumbo, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“The mayor has offered more than taxpayers can afford. But the CTU wants even more control, dictating the wholesale hiring of additional staff. It’s all about <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/john-kass/ct-chicago-teachers-strike-kass-20191018-ml7tm2qgt5dftozyhth2z4rpta-story.html">wresting control of the public schools from the mayor’s office</a>. Lightfoot, a woman of integrity, a liberal Democrat, now finds herself being mugged by the hard-left reality of the new political Chicago… The CTU wants concessions on lower class sizes, and more nurses and librarians and social workers. But is CTU volunteering to slash the pay raise that’s been offered, and will the union support closing all but empty schools?…<br/><br/>“When I talk about union political muscle, I’m not talking about the private sector unions, like carpenters, electricians, plumbers and so on. When private sector unions negotiate contracts with business, they sit across the table from management, which represents shareholders. Eventually, they come to a fair exchange. But who represents the true shareholders here? Pushing back against the public worker unions is not in the Democratic Party’s interest… For taxpayers, it’s a one-way street.”<br/><strong>John Kass, Chicago Tribune</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Warren’s plan, “Harvard University professor Thomas Kane found that amid the empirical progress made by charter schools in Massachusetts just over one year, ‘the oversubscribed charter schools in the Boston area are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warrens-old-school-education-plan-is-a-teachers-union-dream">closing one half of the Black-White achievement gap</a> in math and roughly one fifth of the Black-White achievement gap in English’... [but] Warren wants those schools to go out of business. Those charter schools have given low-income children opportunities for success their parents never would be able to afford and drawn middle-class families back to public education and communities they once fled. Warren’s plan takes us backward.”<br/><strong>Jeanne Allen, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“One recent study by Mathematica Policy Research found that <a href="https://www.aei.org/education/education-freedom-scholarships-give-struggling-families-a-choice-and-a-chance/">students enrolled in certain charter schools were 12.9 percent more likely to go to college</a>. A similar study found that they’re likely to make more money… The highly-touted Success Academy charter system is just one example of this phenomenon… they account for an astounding 20 of the top 30 highest-performing schools in the New York public education system. Yes, like all good schools they demand a lot from parents and students, but the dividends speak for themselves… providing families with options which allow them to escape failing schools improves education for those who need it most.”<br/><strong>Robert Doar, American Enterprise Institute</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.
