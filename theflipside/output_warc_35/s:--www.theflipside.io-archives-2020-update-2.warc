Part of what makes her attractive is that she knows stuff. Serious stuff. Her fight is grounded not just in passion but in knowledge… <br><br>“It’s a fight against economic injustice, but not one based on pitting average Americans against each other. It’s a fight against an economic system that privileges corporations, big banks and the uber-wealthy. It’s founded on an understanding that while discrimination of many kinds runs deep and poisonous in our society, those sicknesses won’t be fixed without a restructuring of the economy.”<br><strong>Mary Schmich, Chicago Tribune</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Rather than condescend to voters, like most politicians, <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=af1d5ca486&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Warren has treated voters as adults, smart enough to handle her wonky style of campaigning</a>… Week in and week out, she has been crisscrossing the country to tell receptive voters her ideas for an ultra-millionaire tax, student debt cancellation and breaking up big tech. She has also weighed in on reproductive rights, vaccines, the opioid crisis and algorithmic discrimination in automated loans. Her bevy of white papers demonstrates that there isn’t a policy area Warren won’t touch and she isn’t worried about repelling anyone with hard-hitting proposals… her polling surge shows that voters appreciate the nerdy policy talk.”<br><strong>Jill Priluck, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>By contrast, “<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=5bc44b3517&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">There was little new in Mr. Trump’s performance</a> [at his rally]. He did not offer a governing vision or even an updated policy focus for a second term. His 76-minute speech was the usual brew of aggrandizement, aggrievement and demonization of political foes. He vilified Democrats as ‘ruthless,’ ‘unhinged’ monsters dedicated to ‘the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.’ He whined about his persecution by the ‘fake news’ and the deep-state rogues who perpetrated the Russia ‘witch hunt.’ He devoted so much time to attacking ‘Crooked Hillary’ that it seemed as though a confused aide might have accidentally loaded one of his 2016 speeches into the teleprompters… <br><br>“It is a tricky line that Mr. Trump will attempt to toe over the next 18 months. As the sitting president, he needs voters to feel good about the job he has done — good enough to turn out and give him another four years. The animating force of his political success, however, has always been cultural grievance. He is the master of stoking voters’ most primal anxieties and resentments. Tuesday’s speech suggests that going forward, the president’s struggle to reconcile these conflicting imperatives will not be pretty — or good for the country. If his message in 2016 was that the political establishment and cultural elitists were exploiting, ignoring and sneering at regular Americans, his message this time is that the opposition despises and is aggressively plotting to destroy MAGA country.”<br><strong>Michelle Cottle, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some argue that “Trump may be historically unpopular, but he is popular enough to be (comfortably) re-elected… Trump has so far delivered to his non-traditional base. The average Republican, commonly referred to as the ‘moderate Republican’, is still not a fan of Trump, who is seen as too confrontational and vulgar, but got the one thing they care about: a tax cut… the Christian right will once again come out strong. While the support for Trump by religious voters puzzles liberals, it is pretty straightforward: the supreme court. Here, again, Trump has delivered…<br><br>“Finally, there is the real Trump supporter, the mostly blue-collar and lower-middle-class white voters who want to ‘build the wall’ (nativism) and ‘drain the swamp’ (populism). So far, they have not really gotten what they wanted… But where can they go?… <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=0f6458dc5c&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Elections are not won by passive majorities but by mobilized minorities</a>… [Trump’s] supporters have agency and urgency, the two things the Democrats are still lacking.

But it’s a stretch to call these all her ideas… <br><br>“The list began with ‘new ethics rules on Supreme Court justices.’ Notably, her proposal here comes from a bill written and introduced by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. Warren signed on as a co-sponsor. Warren also touted ‘A law to force the release of politicians’ tax returns,’ in the Post's words. Warren in early 2017 introduced a bill requiring presidential candidates to disclose three years of returns. But Sen. Ron Wyden had, four months earlier, introduced a similar bill requiring such disclosure — Warren was a cosponsor. A wealth tax on billionaires was the third example. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., laid out the case for a wealth tax back in 2017. Warren rolled hers out in 2019.<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=2a658f2f4d&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">The image of Warren as the policy innovator, it turns out, is a bit of a tall tale</a>, but it's one the media loves to tell.”<br><strong>Timothy P.

Overall, however, she still lags Sanders significantly. Tellingly, her favorable ratings are weak in her home state of Massachusetts. A new Suffolk poll reports her favorables and unfavorables split at 46 percent apiece. Older polling of neighboring New Hampshire placed Warren fourth in the presidential primary race, behind Pete Buttigieg. She doesn’t seem to be faring well with the voters closest to her. A Chicago sports radio host once coined a term to describe situations where the national media was out of step with the locals: ‘out-of-town stupid.’<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=77df954206&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">When this sort of divergence happens, it’s worth asking why</a>.”<br><strong>Warren Henry, The Federalist</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>On the GOP side, in order to be re-elected, “first, [Trump] needs to take credit for the economy, and also avoid messing it up.

The whole rally seemed to preemptively rebuff the standard canon of -isms and -phobias imputed to the Trump movement.

The camera even panned to a multiracial group wearing white shirts which bore the (endearingly forward) assertion ‘Trump &amp; Republicans Aren’t Racist’… <br><br>“The heart of the Trump movement — a reservoir of disaffection and righteous anger — was on full display at the president’s official reelection campaign launch.”<br><strong>John Hirschauer, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>.

Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn’t necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren’s plan would actually cost.”<br/><strong>Megan McArdle, Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=45a4d6b37e&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">A new species of 'cat fox'</a> may be prowling French island of Corsica.<br><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=037f5733bd&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">This creature eats stone.
