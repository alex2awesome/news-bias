Earlier this year, activists with the Sunrise Movement began agitating for the Democratic National Committee to hold a climate debate. While they didn’t get an official debate, they did get a prime-time, science-based, and mostly substantive discussion of climate change. Years of work by activists to elevate climate change to the top of the political agenda resulted in every candidate agreeing on a certain floor for action, including reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the very latest, ending federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and restricting oil and gas leasing on public lands—something the Obama administration resisted.”<br><strong>Zoë Carpenter, The Nation</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The conversation… stood in <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=c80c2eb26e&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">stark contrast to an administration for which the question is not how but whether to address the climate crisis — and the answer is no</a>… Trump has… &nbsp;moved to protect methane leaks, open protected lands and waters to fossil fuel extraction, and help cars and trucks consume gasoline. Why do fossil fuel purveyors keep having their way with administration officials? Partly because they are often one and the same. Take Joe Balash, who resigned as the Interior Department’s assistant secretary for land and minerals management last week to become an executive at an oil company with operations near Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area where Balash and other administration officials have championed fossil fuel extraction… Balash follows other ranking administration officials who have jumped to the energy industry, among them former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, San Francisco Chronicle</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The voter passionately motivated by climate change was once something of an anomaly. But that is changing as President Donald Trump has systematically unraveled the nation's environmental regulations at the same time that Americans have witnessed a series of climate-related crises: fires in the Amazon, hurricanes that churn with increasing fury and record-shattering temperatures and weather events across the US… A Quinnipiac University poll in late August found that <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=4208eb3677&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">56% of registered voters nationwide believe climate change is an emergency</a>… &nbsp;In a new high since Quinnipiac began asking the question in 2015, 67% of voters said the US is not doing enough to address climate change.”<br><strong>Maeve Reston, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Many note that “<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=1ceb97ed31&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Biden’s appearance at the town hall was less than impressive</a>. He repeatedly interrupted himself to jump from one thought to another. When he was asked whether he would ban fossil fuel exports—an issue on which other candidates had disparate but relatively clear views—Biden instantly pivoted to a long account of his efforts on behalf of high-speed rail. Even the shallow matter of what we now call ‘optics’ went badly for Biden.”<br><strong>Jeff Greenfield, Politico</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Bernie’s comment about abortion, “It’s important to note that <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=98be69099e&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">even reversing the Mexico City policy doesn’t mean U.S. funds can go to funding abortions</a>. Congress in 1974 banned the use of U.S. funds for abortion and abortion-related services, and that law remains on the books. The Mexico City policy simply expanded on that to prevent the funding of groups that <em>provide such services</em> — even if the money doesn’t go directly to abortion services… <br><br>“Sanders’s 2016 campaign said he opposes that 1974 law, known as the Helms amendment. So it’s fair to say that he supports federal funding for foreign abortion services. (Hillary Clinton did, too.) But saying he supports that policy in order to ‘abort poor babies for population control’ is taking things to another level. One can support federal funding for abortions domestically, for instance, without believing it should be used specifically to stop population growth… when describing specifically how he would support combating global population growth, Sanders only mentioned birth control. People may infer things from the fact that he invoked ‘reproductive decisions’ in his answer, but he never said he thinks the United States should support abortion as a means of population control.”<br><strong>Aaron Blake, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

To replace it, we’d have to create millions of unproductive taxpayer-funded jobs, layer every inch of available land with solar panels and windmills, and then pray to Gaia that every day is simultaneously sunny and windy.

So maybe Sanders sees himself as just wanting to empower poor women to control their fertility.

Some of the most ardent abortion-rights activists routinely lament the choice to have children, on the grounds that doing so is bad for the environment… Pushing birth control and abortion as a means of lowering population growth, and specifically of eliminating ‘undesirable’ populations, is not a new tactic on the part of progressives. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, for instance, was a pioneer in the eugenics movement’s effort to provide contraception to minority communities, largely to limit the continued growth of what she deemed unwanted populations.
