These congressional leaders – four Democrats and four Republicans – could’ve objected at the time. They chose not to. And yet, at the time and in the months that followed… Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Devin Nunes, defended Trump, pushed his agenda as their own, and in some instances, <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/former-fbi-deputy-director-congress-knew-about-investigation-trump" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">even endorsed the president’s attacks on federal law enforcement</a>.”<br><strong>Steve Benen, MaddowBlog</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“McCabe’s revelation suggests the objections that [Rep.

At the very least, Nunes was apparently aware that the FBI had opened a counterintelligence investigation into the president, and still worked hand in hand with the White House to push a conspiracy theory that the FBI and intelligence agencies were compromised by anti-Trump bias.”<br><strong>Aaron Rupar, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“In order to remove Trump from office using the 25th Amendment, you would need the support of a loyal Vice President, eight Cabinet members appointed by Trump, and about two out of every five Republicans in the House and Senate… If Mr. McCabe is to be believed, the biggest surprise to come out of the ‘60 Minutes’ interview was that both the deputy attorney general and acting director of the FBI were seemingly unaware that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/opinions/mccabe-25th-amendment-trump-shock-sracic/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">what they were discussing was utter fantasy</a>.”<br><strong>Paul Sracic, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>McCabe expressed his willingness to testify before Congress, stating, “I will cooperate with the committee in whatever way I can… But I will say this: If all they are interested in is Rod Rosenstein's mention of the 25th Amendment or Rod Rosenstein's offer to wear a wire — if that's all they're interested in — it will be a very short and uneventful hearing… <br><br>“I invite the committee, or any other committee on the Hill, to look beyond that, to ask themselves why is it <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/695646320/andrew-mccabe-fbi-investigations-into-trump-were-extraordinary-steps" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">two of the highest ranking officials in the Department of Justice and the FBI</a> in May of 2017 had to even consider the fact that the president of the United States might pose a national security risk to this country.

What I do believe is that a president who currently lives under an impeachment sword of Damocles appears to have been injudiciously targeted by a small group of supposedly apolitical public servants who panicked during a time of gravity-defying populism and ignored time-tested processes, protocols, and prohibitions.”<br><strong>James Gagliano, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Congress needs to “ask how the FBI came to see itself as the arbiter of what is in the national security interest of the U.S… <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-19/rod-rosenstein-has-some-explaining-to-do" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">No one elected Andrew McCabe, James Comey or anyone else at the FBI to lead the country</a>.

This is not its appointed role in our system. If the president abuses his powers, that’s a matter for Congress to take up, not for executive-branch officials whose panic eclipsed their judgment.”<br><strong>Rich Lowry, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.
