Indeed, debate moderators and other Democratic candidates should have never let her escape the first debates without direct questions about her unnatural fluency with both Syrian and Russian talking points. Gabbard even emulates the stiff, unnatural cadences of Russian rhetoric, as when she referred to Clinton on Twitter as the ‘queen of the warmongers’—the Russians used to refer to the close Clinton ally Madeleine Albright as ‘Madam War.’ She repeatedly echoes pro–Bashar al-Assad propaganda in using the phrase <em>regime-change war</em>to describe the U.S. presence in Syria… <br/><br/>“[But] Clinton’s accusation that Gabbard is a tool of the Russians was so blunt and clumsy that it has added new life to a primary bid that should never have existed in the first place. Within a day, Gabbard was already fundraising off of it, a development as predictable as a sunrise… Far from exposing or thwarting Gabbard… <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/hillary-clinton-elevating-tulsi-gabbard/600370/">the former secretary of state overshot the mark by making an accusation without proof</a>.”<br/><strong>Tom Nichols, The Atlantic</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“No evidence was offered to support this assertion, nor have frequent allegations that Russia is helping Gabbard’s campaign been proven… Obama administration official and current CNN commentator Van Jones called Clinton’s comments ‘disinformation’ on that network Friday. ‘I do not want someone of her stature to legitimate these attacks against anybody,’ Jones said. ‘If you’ve got real evidence, come forward with it. But if you’re just going to smear people casually on podcasts, you are playing right into the Russians’ hands’… As [the acting director of national intelligence] notes, the very fact that a Russia misinformation campaign is in the public discourse <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/19/20922122/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard-queen-warmongers-russia-2020-election" target="_blank">hampers the democratic process by damaging public trust.</a>”<br/><strong>Riley Beggin, Vox</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard.html">some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard</a>. They like the Hawaiian congresswoman’s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms. Then there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her ‘Mommy’ and praising her willingness to criticize Israel… <br/><br/>“Some of those who have worked with Ms. Gabbard say that, as an Iraq war veteran whose chief message is that America should stop trying to police the world, she is representing viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad… Still, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election and the D.N.C. is well aware of the frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard in the Russian state news media. An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Ms. Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits.”<br/><strong>Lisa Lerer, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p><strong><em>Dated but relevant: </em></strong>“The fact is that a foreign policy that elevates America&#x27;s narrow national interest above any broader concerns will inevitably lead to unsavory realpolitik alliances, regardless of whether it is pro- or anti-war. If ‘The Blob’ — as the bipartisan interventionist foreign policy establishment is sarcastically called — has a tendency to exaggerate the threat posed to the international order by regimes that don&#x27;t play by America&#x27;s rules in order to justify overthrowing them, Gabbard-style anti-interventionist nationalists have a tendency to downplay the threat that odious regimes who play ball with America pose for their own people in order to enlist them… <br/><br/>“It is not a coincidence that Gabbard has questioned whether Assad actually deployed chemical weapons against innocent Syrians at all. Or that she has praised [Egyptian dictator] Sisi for his ‘great courage and leadership.’ Or that she refused to support a House resolution that offered the 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom — which occurred on [Indian Prime Minister] Modi&#x27;s watch — as an example of India&#x27;s persecution of its religious minorities… <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/855766/tulsi-gabbard-no-peacenik">The very politicos who are anti-war often become pro-dictator</a>. Unfortunately, Democratic presidential contender Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman from Hawaii, is no different.” <br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, The Week</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note that “[Warren] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has. She has also provided more overall policy detail, including on the taxes she would raise, than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. And <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=6b85261e4f&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">her Medicare plan comes much, much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts</a>. I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas… The biggest weakness of Warren’s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system. Warren would not let people opt into Medicare, a wildly popular idea. She would force them to join… she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon.”<br/><strong>David Leonhardt, New York Times</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-25/trump-ukraine-call-transcript-has-impeachment-worthy-evidence?srnd=opinion">Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time</a>. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”<br/><strong>Noah Feldman, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

For Gabbard to be a Russian asset, she would thus either have to be taking direction from a Russian intelligence service or intentionally working on behalf of one of those services. There is no evidence that this is the case. Nor is there evidence that Gabbard is being used by the Kremlin to gain influence in Washington (an access agent), or to purvey Russian propaganda (a useful idiot). The truth is more basic: Gabbard is a Kremlin favorite because <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/hillary-clinton-makes-the-wrong-criticism-of-tulsi-gabbard-on-russia">her policy ideas fit with Russian strategic objectives</a>. That&#x27;s as far as it goes.”<br/><strong>Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Gabbard’s foreign policy views may well be wrongheaded ones. But <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/hillary-clinton-accusations-tulsi-gabbard-put-up-or-shut-up/">she’s direct and honest about them</a>, and it’s highly unlikely that she’s been bribed, brainwashed or coerced into these positions… In Gabbard’s worldview, the preeminent priority of the United States is avoiding terror attacks and avoiding getting sucked into wars triggered by terror attacks. While she rarely says so explicitly, her experience suggests she sees the the best option to pursue this difficult goal is to reach deals with the brutal but non-Islamist dictators and monarchs who will keep order… History suggests [however] that American alliances of convenience with unsavory dictators rarely last or turn out well for us, whether it’s Stalin, Marcos, the Shah, Saddam Hussein against the Iranians, Pakistan… <br/><br/>“Until Hillary Clinton or anyone else generates some actual proof, treat Tulsi Gabbard for what she appears to be — an impassioned isolationist who believes the United States has no business attempting to spread our values or stand up for human rights abroad, and who’s comfortable working with brutal dictators if the end result is fewer American casualties. Not every bad or controversial idea in public life is a sign of a sinister conspiracy.”<br/><strong>Jim Geraghty, National Review</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Tulsi Gabbard is a progressive, Samoan American woman, and Democratic candidate for president. But apparently we’re supposed to believe <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-new-york-times-smears-tulsi-gabbard-as-an-alt-right-russian-stooge">she’s also a Russian stooge and alt-right figurehead</a>… It’s frankly astounding that… the <em>Times</em> would cite<em>supporting drug decriminalization</em> as evidence that someone panders to the alt-right…<br/><br/>“The anti-Semitic alt-right loves Rep. Ilhan Omar for her criticisms of Israel. But something tells me the Times (rightly) won’t use that as evidence that the left-wing Muslim woman of color is secretly alt-right. Fringe figures are going to support somebody, and Gabbard has denounced their support in no uncertain terms. No one can point to any actual racism in Gabbard’s record, so this amounts to little more than a vicious smear of a candidate who dares stray from mainline Democrat orthodoxy.”<br/><strong>Brad Polumbo, Washington Examiner</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Gabbard hasn’t scored above 3% in any poll, and she has a lot more zeroes than threes. Her current polling aggregation average is 1.2%.<em>If</em> the Russians are ‘grooming’ her, they’re terrible at their jobs. This, of course, is part of the same conceit of Russiagate all along. We have spent the last three years hyperventilating over a Russian ‘merry prankster’ disinformation campaign that spent $25 million in a cycle where the two candidates and their allies spent well over <em>two billion dollars</em> on messaging. No one — not a single person — has ever shown that the Russian social-media campaign ever changed a single voter’s mind, regardless of their intent. <a href="https://hotair.com/archives/ed-morrissey/2019/10/18/new-hillary-theory-russians-grooming-gabbard-third-party-bid/">This is an insane conspiracy theory</a>.”<br/><strong>Ed Morrissey, Hot Air</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Clinton lost 2016 not because of Russian interference but because she was a horrible, completely unlikeable candidate. It’s a truth Clinton and her minions seem unable and unwilling to accept. Any time Clinton and her ilk rail against Russian interference or suggest President Donald Trump wasn’t legitimately elected simply plays into his hands and does nothing to bring in former Trump voters who may be on the fence for 2020… <br/><br/>“The best advice for Clinton and her allies is to stop suggesting any sort of divergence from the typical party line on foreign policy automatically means Russian influence. It’s more than likely Russian-owned stations see Gabbard as friendly because she’s not willing to commit U.S. troops to every potential global conflict.
