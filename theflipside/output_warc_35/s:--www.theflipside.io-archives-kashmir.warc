Meanwhile, India’s $2.7 trillion economy, more than eight times as large as Pakistan’s, gives it international heft.

While the Pakistan Army has waged counterinsurgency against Islamist and insurgent forces, it did just enough to receive continued U.S. military and financial aid, but not enough to prevail against an ethnic group that will be there long after a withdrawal by the West. <a href="https://spectator.org/india-battens-down-the-hatches/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Of late, the Taliban has expressed concern over the welfare of Kashmiris</a> — operating in the future with the platform of a nation state in concert with the Pakistan Army and ISI, it constitutes an ominous and potentially aggressive threat to India’s national security well beyond the status quo.”<br><strong>Frank Schell, The American Spectator</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Some note that “Modi’s dislike of Muslim influence in India is well known.

In Colorado, voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap, money that the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers. In Sussex County, N.J., voters approved, by a 2-to-1 margin, a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/is-trump-locked-and-loaded-for-war-with-iran/">guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom</a> if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war.

The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels.

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

India's GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India's usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br data-w-id="4f47abba-fec2-0ed9-8477-aaba8520a905"><strong data-w-id="fa405e4f-9387-11db-e28f-0e6e236b61f4">Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/19/tommy-the-tortoise-worlds-oldest-living-pet-turns-121/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Tommy the tortoise, world’s oldest living pet, turns 121</a>.<br><strong>New York Post</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
