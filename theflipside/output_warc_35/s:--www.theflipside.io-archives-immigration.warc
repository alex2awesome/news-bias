We don’t do that in America, or at least we shouldn’t… Before we’re called naive, we are not saying that undocumented criminal immigrants shouldn’t be removed. They are a public menace and should be deported. Yes, go after criminals. And yes, people should not have overstayed their tourist visas, which a fair amount of the undocumented have done. But <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article231870293.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the round up is a Gestapo tactic unworthy of us</a>… Let’s hope [Trump’s] correction is a return to some sanity and a show of compassion.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Miami Herald</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding migrant detention centers, “Trump essentially dismissed the plight of migrant children while speaking with Chuck Todd on <em>Meet the Press</em>. ‘This has been happening long before I got there,’ the president said when pressed about the conditions. ‘We’ve ended [family] separation. Under President Obama, you had separation. I was the one who ended it.’ ‘We’re doing a fantastic job, under the circumstances,’ he added. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-dismisses-treatment-migrant-kids-border-torture-851581/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">None of this is true</a>. Families attempting to cross the border under President Obama were separated only in rare circumstances, such as when there was concern for the safety of the child, or when the adult could not be confirmed to be the child’s parent… <br><br>“Though Trump signed an executive order to suspend his own administration’s zero-tolerance policy, children are still being separated from their parents if authorities deem the parent poses a risk to the child. Such separations are on the rise, often for reasons as petty as the parent having a traffic violation on their record.”<br><strong>Ryan Bort, Rolling Stone</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“US Border Patrol is holding many children, including some who are much too young to take care of themselves, in jail-like border facilities for weeks at a time without contact with family members, regular access to showers, clean clothes, toothbrushes, or proper beds. Many are sick. Many, including children as young as 2 or 3, have been separated from adult caretakers without any provisions for their care… The Trump administration wants more money to build more child detention centers to hold even more children… But that ask glosses over the fact that more children are in immigration custody because over the last several years the government has slowed down the rate at which children are reunified with their families… <br><br>“Based on our interviews, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/opinions/children-migrant-centers-at-border-long-austin-hillery/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">officials at the border seem to be making no effort to release children to caregivers</a>-- many have parents in the US -- rather than holding them for weeks in overcrowded cells at the border… Congress should take action -- not by approving more money for detention -- but by requiring immigration agencies to cease separating children from family members unless that's in the interest of the child, release and reunify children as soon as possible and cease using them as bait to arrest family members.”<br><strong>Clara Long and Nicole Austin-Hillery, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some point out that “The government’s ‘safe and sanitary’ argument did not arise from a new case generated by Trump-administration policies. It arose in 1985, during the Reagan administration, when a 15-year-old Salvadoran child named Jenny Lisette Flores was detained after entering the United States illegally, hoping to escape her country’s vicious civil war. Flores spent two months at a facility in California, confined with adult strangers in poor conditions and strip-searched regularly… <br><br>“It is right and fit to condemn the Trump administration for its argument and its treatment of children. But… this administration is merely the latest one to subject immigrant children to abusive conditions. It’s been 35 years since Jenny Flores was strip-searched in an adult facility. Before Sarah Fabian defended concrete floors and bright lights for President Donald Trump, she defended putting kids in solitary confinement for President Barack Obama… <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/why-sarah-fabian-argued-against-giving-kids-toothbrushes/592366/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">This stain on America’s soul will not wash out with an election cycle</a>.”<br><strong>Ken White, The Atlantic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note that “[Warren] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has. She has also provided more overall policy detail, including on the taxes she would raise, than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. And <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=6b85261e4f&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">her Medicare plan comes much, much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts</a>. I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas… The biggest weakness of Warren’s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system. Warren would not let people opt into Medicare, a wildly popular idea. She would force them to join… she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon.”<br/><strong>David Leonhardt, New York Times</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-25/trump-ukraine-call-transcript-has-impeachment-worthy-evidence?srnd=opinion">Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time</a>. They will also say that there’s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here. But… ‘even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly, the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis. Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”<br/><strong>Noah Feldman, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) writes, “The root cause of the record-breaking surge in migrants is the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-crenshaw-democrats-mexico-border" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">widespread abuse of our asylum system</a>. Because of a massive backlog of asylum cases and an inability to quickly adjudicate and enforce them, more migrants are making the journey to our border. They bring children with them to take advantage of our loopholes, knowing we must release family units within 20 days… As it stands now, the incentives are aligned to permit illegal immigrants to cross the border with a child, knowing full well that they will be caught and released into society without the chance of deportation.”<br><strong>Dan Crenshaw, Fox News</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/to-win-on-immigration-trump-must-address-both-its-security-and-humanitarian-crises" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">To make immigration a winning issue, Trump must own both its security and humanitarian aspects</a>. As it stands, Democrats largely ignore the security crisis and Republicans severely downplay its humanitarian toll. Caught up in their partisan bickering, both parties fail to understand the significance of immigration: Their neglect of the other side’s concerns is proof of that. If this cycle continues, neither side will achieve a permanent solution. By acknowledging the humanity of the migrants seeking asylum while maintaining pressure on congressional Democrats to pull their weight and advocating for enhanced security, Trump might just unite both sides under a coherent policy he can carry into 2020.” <br><strong>Kaylee McGhee, The Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels.

Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn’t necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren’s plan would actually cost.”<br/><strong>Megan McArdle, Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Researchers <a href="https://mashable.com/article/uk-study-seals-sing-twinkle-twinkle-star-wars-theme/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">trained seals to sing 'Twinkle Twinkle' and the 'Star Wars' theme song</a>.<br><strong>Mashable</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
