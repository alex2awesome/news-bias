In 2009, for example, a South Carolina Republican, Representative Bob Inglis, proposed a carbon tax bill. Koch Industries stopped funding his campaign, donated heavily to a primary opponent named Trey Gowdy and helped organize teams of Tea Party activists who traveled to town hall meetings to protest against Mr. Inglis. Some of the town hall meetings devolved into angry affairs, where Mr. Inglis couldn’t make himself heard above the shouting. Mr. Inglis lost re-election, and his defeat sent a message to other Republicans: Koch’s orthodoxy on climate rules could not be violated.”<br><strong>Christopher Leonard, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Koch Industries can “claim the distinction of being one of the country’s most highly polluting companies, behind only ExxonMobil and American Electric Power… By Greenpeace’s reckoning, in the 20 years to 2017, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/23/david-koch-death-kochtopus-legacy-right-wing" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the Kochs ploughed about $127m into 92 groups that were involved in rebuffing climate crisis solutions</a>… There has been much discussion in recent months about the very public spat between the president and the Koch brothers, with the Kochs calling Trump’s trade tariffs ‘detrimental’ and Trump lashing back that the billionaires were ‘a total joke’. With the exception of trade policy, which is anathema to the free market Koch view of the world, the truth about Trump, though, is that he has adopted many of the rightwing postures the Kochs have long espoused.”<br><strong>Ed Pilkington, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some argue that, “like all giants in a society, <a href="https://time.com/5660040/david-koch-legacy/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">his legacy is unwieldy and full of contradictions that defy a simple reading</a>. As a 42% stakeholder in the second largest privately held company in the country, Koch was said to have a net worth of around $50 billion, making him the 11th-richest person on the planet… But unlike others in his ranks, Koch had one of the freest wallets for charities of his choosing: his lifetime philanthropic giving topped $1 billion to causes such as the Smithsonian, Lincoln Center and cancer research. He patronized groups that preached civility even as he nudged his political arm to portray Obama as an existential threat to American capitalism. Such complications only made Koch that much more of an enigma, a role he hardly minded.”<br><strong>Philip Elliott, Time</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p data-w-id="4c112471-f7a5-7fef-6f33-502c772ed4a4">“Koch’s principles were not purely partisan.
