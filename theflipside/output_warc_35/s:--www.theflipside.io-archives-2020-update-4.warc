He was not. Was he better than in the first debate at the end of June? He was -- by a significant amount. After a polling slide in the wake of the first debate, Biden appears to have stabilized in the low 30s, which gives him double the support of his next rival. We still have doubts as to whether his message -- Trumpism is a fever that will break and politics will be good again -- is one that an angry Democratic base will buy. But for now, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/2020-democratic-presidential-candidates-ranked/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Biden remains the frontrunner -- and clearly so</a>.”<br><strong>Chris Cillizza and Harry Enten, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“If [Biden's] rivals want to take him down, they need to take him down with the kind of arguments that could hurt him in a general election.

Or maybe he won’t, in which case his head-to-head polling will plummet and his electability argument will collapse. Either way, the country will be better-served by having this argument sooner rather than later.”<br><strong>Matthew Yglesias, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding Warren, “[she] is not only among the most liberal candidates in the 2020 field; she’s also an older, white, intellectual woman running in the aftermath of the Hillary Clinton debacle, and she follows in a long line of failed presidential nominees from Massachusetts. Dukakis ’88. Kerry ’04. Romney ’12. It’s entirely too easy to caricature her as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/08/elizabeth-warren-all-important-electability-question/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">liberal-elite former Harvard professor</a> whom President Trump could drub with those oh-so-important working-class white voters… <br><br>“Polls suggest, for now, that Democratic voters are more concerned with beating Trump than with ideological purity. Warren’s job will be to convince them that she’s got enough of the former for people to vote for the candidate with the latter.”<br><strong>Aaron Blake, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p><strong><em>Dated but relevant:</em></strong> “Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are two of the most ideologically aligned candidates in the Democratic primary… But the fellow enemies of the 1 percent have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/sanders-warren-voters-2020-1408548" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">surprisingly different bases of support</a>. In poll after poll, Sanders appeals to lower-income and less-educated people; Warren beats Sanders among those with postgraduate degrees. Sanders performs better with men, Warren with women.

One of the more amusing elements of post-debate punditry has been to see right-wing commentators desperately trying to pump up Democratic presidential candidates who might roil the party, such as Marianne Williamson or Tulsi Gabbard… [But] <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/07/why-i-think-chances-donald-trumps-re-election-are-getting-worse/?noredirect=on" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Democrats seem both energized and pragmatic</a>.

Each of these three developments hurts his standing with a key voter group he’s counting on to win a second term…<br><br>“Of course, Trump still has 15 months to go before Election Day and can count on the support of millions of diehards who won’t be swayed by racist massacres or sudden swoons in the Dow. But he’ll need to build a broader coalition to win a second term.

At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

His support is also constant across income brackets…<br><br>“If Sanders eventually gives way to Warren in the left lane of the primary, there could be a head-to-head bloodbath between two candidates drawing stark ideological lines but both capable of courting the party elite.

Something similar is shaping up for the Democrats in 2020… <br><br>“Biden, like Kerry, is an old political warhorse. For now, he poses as the Democratic establishment’s only safe bet. Like Kerry, Biden has lots of flaws, is an erratic campaigner and is gaffe-prone.

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”<br/><strong>Kyle Smith, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>. As much as Warren is articulate, obviously intelligent, and energetically supported by Democrats, she would also be far easier to defeat than Joe Biden… Considering Trump&#x27;s economy, the president is well placed to defeat Warren.”<br/><strong>Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner </strong></p></div></div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="column-60 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div><div class="column-61 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-7 w-clearfix"><div id="w-node-c9ca80732245-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide center w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div id="w-node-c9ca80732246-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide libertarian w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p><strong>A libertarian&#x27;s take</strong></p><p>“Why did Modi pick this moment to do something so radical? Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/08/239615/skittles-halloween-rotten-zombie-candy-flavor" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Zombie Skittles is giving candy a terrifying, undead twist </a>this Halloween.</p><p>‍<strong>Refinery29</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
