It’s a losing and unnecessary battle. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=7ee9da2d5c&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Democrats actually believe in capitalism</a>. They just don’t like the ruthless, runaway version that has betrayed and antagonized working people… <br><br>“Healthy capitalism starts with stronger competition. When powerful companies aren’t regulated, the first thing they do is crush or buy out their competitors to escape market pressure. To preserve the market, the government has to constrain such behavior… It’s true that much of what was said on stage was dogmatic, tone-deaf, and self-destructive. But that’s only half the story. The other half is that through these debates, Democrats are beginning to articulate new ways of thinking about these problems and solving them.”<br><strong>William Saletan, Slate</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=ed225c5a92&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">The Democratic candidates are talking more honestly about health care than about immigration</a>. To develop a coherent approach to immigration in an era of rising asylum claims, Democrats need to explain—among other things—whom they would and wouldn’t let in… One of the internationally accepted legal criteria for who deserves asylum—fear based on ‘membership of a particular social group’—is extremely vague. Different immigration judges interpret it in vastly different ways. Since those judges currently work for the attorney general, and thus ultimately for the president, the Democratic candidates need to clarify what standard they support… They need to do so to let primary voters make an informed choice. And they need to do so before Donald Trump launches an onslaught of nativist attacks next year. The 2020 Democratic candidates don’t actually support open borders. They’re just not yet comfortable explaining why.”<br><strong>Peter Beinart, The Atlantic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Democrats can [also] spend more time talking about the party’s emerging solutions to the single most urgent crisis in the news right now… Plans have been introduced by House Democrats and Senate Democrats… These plans include things such as increased funding to Northern Triangle countries; creating additional in-country options for asylum seekers to apply for refugee status from afar to disincentivize the trek to the border; big investments in judges and programs to track asylum-seeking families awaiting hearings; and so forth… <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=a5068d47d7&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">There’s more consensus here than you think</a>.”<br><strong>Greg Sargent, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some argue, “Activists are pressing candidates to take aggressively progressive stands on broad issues like Medicare-for-all but also narrower ones like including undocumented immigrants in health care plans and providing relief from graduate school debt. This is, however, precisely the wrong lesson to learn from the Trump era. It’s true that Trump is president, but <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=8fb004ccba&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">it’s <em>not</em>true that Trump ran and won as an ideological extremist</a>… <br><br>“Trump ran as an Iraq War [opponent] who vowed to avoid new Middle Eastern military adventures, as an opponent of cutting Social Security and Medicare (and Medicaid), and as the first-ever Republican candidate to try to position himself as an ally to the LGBTQ community — going so far as to actually speak the words ‘LGBTQ’… Far from being a counterexample to the theory that moderation pays off, Trump’s election is, if anything, a testament to its power. The millions of progressives baffled that someone as coarse, ignorant, and scandal-plagued as Trump could win an election should reflect on the fact that he was able to partially recover from those things due to his positions on the issues.”<br><strong>Matthew Yglesias, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Others ask, “<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=7f3eb7f9b8&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">In what sense are the Dems moving too far left?</a>… Voters want to raise taxes on the rich and expand government social programs. In moving to the left on taxes and spending, then, Democrats are actually moving toward voters’ preferences, not away from them… On fiscal and economic responsibility: Nobody who endorsed the 2017 tax cut has any right to criticize Democratic proposals to spend more on things like child care. That tax cut, after all, appears likely to add around $2 trillion to federal debt — with around a third of that going to foreigners. Meanwhile, the promised surge in business investment is nowhere to be seen…<br><br>“Last but not least, if your view is that the progressive agenda is morally wrong, that people shouldn’t receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes… [then] you should be calling on ‘donor’ states like New Jersey and New York to cut off places like Kentucky and let their economies collapse. And if that’s what you mean, you should let Mitch McConnell’s constituents know about it.”<br><strong>Paul Krugman, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial. But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence: it’s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed — such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-25/trump-ukraine-call-transcript-has-impeachment-worthy-evidence?srnd=opinion">Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time</a>.

Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.”<br/><strong>Noah Feldman, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

Another example was ‘open borders.’ Trump and the Republicans often speak about how the Democrats are for ‘open borders,’ or allowing anyone to enter the country, regardless of need for asylum or ability to contribute to society. I’m not sure that’s the consensus Democratic view… But when asked about what they would do about people crossing the border, no Democrat seemed to take the position that the U.S. should be able to decide (fairly) who needs to be offered asylum and who could be – safely and fairly – refused entry.”<br><strong>Arnon Mishkin, Fox News</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“On several polarizing issues, <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=39050af15a&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Democrats are refusing to offer the reassurances to moderate opinion that they once did</a>.

Twice as many Democrats are over 65 than are under 30. More than half of Democrats who voted in 2018 identify themselves as moderate or conservative. ‘Very liberal’ Americans account for only 19 percent of the party’s voters. There is absolutely no need for Biden to be afraid of the Left. He was doing fine without them, they’re absolutely prepared to vote for him over Trump, and what Democrats crave is electability, which they think he’s got more of than anyone else. He doesn’t need to buy off the activists during primary season.

Attack ads against Republicans in 2018 focused on the provision of a bill that would have weakened protections for those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi’s Democrats said Republicans would ‘raise your premiums’ and ‘kick you off your health-care plan’… <br><br>“For good measure they accused Republicans of ‘doubling the debt.’ Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tried to tamp down the story of the migrant caravan then traveling through Mexico, calling President Trump’s focus on it a distraction from health care. Pelosi’s Democrats retook the Rust Belt districts that Donald Trump had won in 2016… [She must have watched the] Democratic primary debates in horror.”<br><strong>Michael Brendan Dougherty, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“A presidential election loss discredits the party’s insiders, and so the outsider grassroots say, with vehemence—and oftentimes no little justification—<em>it’s our turn, give us a chance</em>. Thus the activists, fired by ideological zeal, seize control of the party’s nomination… <br><br>“They raise their voices, walk the precincts, show up at meetings, flock to the polls, and generally set the tone for the party. That’s how the left-wing Senator George McGovern of South Dakota won the 1972 Democratic nomination. There was no social media back then, but if there had been, McGovern would have dominated Democratic Twitter. Yet of course, <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=40c1061988&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">dominating the intra-party discussion is not the same thing as winning an inter-party election</a>. So while McGovern surged to win the Democratic nomination in the summer of 1972, he crashed in his actual bid to win the White House that November. He crashed badly, in fact—he lost 49 states.”<br><strong>James P.

The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn’t necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren’s plan would actually cost.”<br/><strong>Megan McArdle, Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=1900199385&e=4c7e142432" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Man spreading joy by standing in front of things</a>.</p><p>‍<strong>WOWK 13</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
