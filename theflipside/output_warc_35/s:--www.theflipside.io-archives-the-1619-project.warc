Elements of it were conducted in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution, a venerable pillar of American learning.

That’s why an alternative vision of patriotism, like the one that Nikole Hannah-Jones articulated in the 1619 Project’s opening essay—‘Black Americans… have served, generation after generation, in an overlooked but vital role: It is we who have been the perfecters of this democracy’—is so valuable… <br><br>“This is a complex and yet immediately legible argument, expressed as public history, buttressed in the package by other arguments that are in turn informed by years of academic historical work.

There is no room for a nuanced patriotism that sees a nation with racism as a central part of its DNA, but also a nation that can be improved through constant struggle and work. It is the ‘America: Love It or Leave It’ bumper sticker, expressed in more florid prose… The 1619 Project challenges not only the founders’ innocence but that of white Americans who downplay racism’s vitality today… <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=493778bd2d&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">The furious reaction from the American right only proves how much their work [is] needed</a>.”<br><strong>Zack Beauchamp, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“There is a James Baldwin quote that I have had tattooed on my consciousness: ‘I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.’ That is the animating spirit of endeavors like the 1619 Project, which — if people bothered to read it — shows it is possible to depict our ugliness through beauty, to artfully weave a reader’s eyes and mind through a re-examination of the very soil beneath their feet so that they see it anew, and more clearly. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=7d29e28259&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It is a vision test for the soul</a>, and it certainly helps us not only view America in greater relief, but those working to inhibit its growth and empowerment.”<br><strong>Jamil Smith, Rolling Stone</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p><strong><em>Minority view: </em></strong>“There is a lot to admire in the paper's presentation of the 1619 Project — searing photographs, illuminating quotations from archival material, samples of poetry and fiction giving powerful voice to the black experience, and gripping journalistic summaries of scholarly histories… The country's treatment of the slaves and their descendants through the century following emancipation and, in some respects, on down to the present was and is appalling — and the story of how it happened, and keeps happening, is extremely important for understanding the United States… <br><br>“[But] throughout the issue of the<em>NYTM</em>, headlines make, with just slight variations, the same rhetorical move over and over again: ‘Here is something unpleasant, unjust, or even downright evil about life in the present-day United States.

Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation.

It seeks to divide, not heal. It seeks to give power and primacy to those who think the nation’s founding was premised on evil… Americans, particularly white Americans, need to learn more about slavery in the United States.

In regard to the former, 1619 makes a compelling case that slavery played a big role in this, because it did. This is something few serious people would argue with. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&id=37d08e50e8&e=3b34384e6b" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">What is less clear is how reframing American history as a tale of evil is going to fix the problem</a>. As if somehow non-black Americans will have their eyes opened to how important slavery was and suddenly have policy fixes to change outcomes.
