The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP, the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980. This is hardly a picture of a budget that’s skyrocketing out of control.

While it's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid, self-inflicted government shutdown, Congress is whistling past the graveyard. That's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming — up 23% in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone. That's not supposed to happen. And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn.”<br><strong>John Avlon, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“It's often overlooked, but <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemadowitz/status/1153663511886749697" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">the biggest economic improvement since Trump took office is more government spending</a>.”<br><strong>Michael Madowitz, Twitter</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“I don’t doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down… But Congressional Republicans’ overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump’s inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount… House Democrats, meanwhile, have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending.

Except for a brief shutdown in January 2018 over immigration that was quickly, and wisely, abandoned, congressional Democrats haven’t tried to take the government hostage during the Trump administration. (The only protracted shutdown of the Trump presidency was instigated by Trump, effectively taking his own government hostage in order to win border wall money. It didn’t work.)

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency. To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”<br/><strong>Kyle Smith, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>. As much as Warren is articulate, obviously intelligent, and energetically supported by Democrats, she would also be far easier to defeat than Joe Biden… Considering Trump&#x27;s economy, the president is well placed to defeat Warren.”<br/><strong>Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner </strong></p></div></div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="column-60 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div><div class="column-61 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-7 w-clearfix"><div id="w-node-c9ca80732245-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide center w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div id="w-node-c9ca80732246-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide libertarian w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p><strong>A libertarian&#x27;s take</strong></p><p>“Why did Modi pick this moment to do something so radical? Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="http://www.fox9.com/news/boy-goes-missing-found-after-riding-john-deere-toy-ride-on-tractor-to-fair" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Deputies find toddler who took off on toy tractor at county fair</a> in Rush City, Minn.<br><strong>Fox 9</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
