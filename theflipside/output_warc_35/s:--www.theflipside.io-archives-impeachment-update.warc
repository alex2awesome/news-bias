If he has a specific claim that his circumscribed right to executive privilege should prevent the turnover of a particular document or the testimony of a particular witness, he should make a case-by-case argument. Instead, he has essentially claimed that he can ignore Congress if he so chooses.

In fact, the Constitution unambiguously empowers the House to conduct an impeachment, and it grants the president no authority to impede it.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“It’s one thing for Republicans to argue that there was no explicit quid pro quo in Trump’s telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president. It’s quite another for them to agree that the president should be free to engage in witness tampering, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice, or that the legislative branch should be powerless to exercise its constitutional authority against the executive branch. Indeed, the more partisan the Republican, the easier he or she will find it to imagine that a corrupt Democrat at some point will occupy the White House. Should that dark day come to pass, wouldn’t they then regret having given Trump free rein?... By redefining the crisis as an existential debate over the limits of presidential power, Trump may be in danger of <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=09ebc9677a&amp;e=4c7e142432">losing those Republicans who still think of themselves as constitutional conservatives</a>.”<br/><strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding the issue of a formal vote to launch an impeachment investigation, many argue that “<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=f7f4115256&amp;e=4c7e142432">holding a vote now may… limit the efficacy of the subpoenas</a>already churning through the justice system—or at least give Trump’s litigators an argument for starting over… If a vote is taken now, the president’s lawyers are likely to argue that the prior requests were thus not included in the impeachment inquiry… Such a vote may also limit the House investigators in what they can investigate… it is important that the House not limit itself to abuses of power already known, as all indications suggest the impeachable conduct will continue… Finally, a vote requires difficult political choices… many red and purple district Democrats may be waiting to see what evidence emerges from the House investigations before determining whether impeachment is warranted. A party-line vote now—or one with some Democrats voting against—gives Trump ammunition to call the investigation partisan and to further refuse to cooperate.”<br/><strong>Molly Claflin, Slate</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=56a453875e&amp;e=4c7e142432">The Constitution makes it clear the House has the ‘sole’ discretion to impeach and the Senate has the ‘sole’ ability to hold a trial</a>. In other words, impeachment is purely a function of the legislative branch; not the executive, and not the judicial… Even if Trump and Republicans keep hammering their argument about precedent, there’s no sign in the letter they will take Democrats to court to try to dictate how the inquiry plays out… That’s probably because they know the courts will likely stay out of it: In past cases challenging impeachments (mostly of federal judges), the courts have upheld Congress’s right to impeach and have a trial… In short, the White House’s precedent claims amount to a political ploy, not a legal one.”<br/><strong>Ella Nilsen, Vox</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Fifteen current Republican senators served in the House or Senate during the Clinton impeachment. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=733fcef5c4&amp;e=4c7e142432">All but one of those — Sen.

The reasons for not holding a vote on opening an impeachment inquiry appear to be self-interested and craven, which only underscores the White House’s point. Authorizing an impeachment inquiry would give the Republican minority the right to call its own witnesses and otherwise participate in the investigation… <br/><br/>“Schiff has already been caught lying on TV about staffers on his own intelligence committee being in contact with the Ukraine-call whistleblower before the formal complaint that led to the current impeachment efforts was filed… Impeachment is a gravely serious step to take, as it threatens to overturn the will of voters. So far, Democrats aren’t taking the impeachment process seriously. So they should not be surprised that Trump isn’t taking it seriously, either.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, New York Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“If there is to be an inquiry about invoking this most solemn and consequential of the House’s powers, the House must vote to conduct it. It is not for the Speaker and her adjutants to decree that there is an inquiry. If the inquiry is to be legitimate, the House as a whole must decide to conduct it. Members of the House are the representatives of the sovereign — the People. In November 2020, the People are scheduled to vote on whether Donald Trump should keep his job. If Democrats, who control the House, truly believe the president has committed impeachable offenses and is so unfit for his duties that we can’t wait just 13 months for the sovereign to render that verdict, then they should vote to conduct an impeachment inquiry. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=202913c32a&amp;e=4c7e142432">If they are afraid to vote on it, then they shouldn’t be doing it</a>.”<br/><strong>Andrew C.

The media that now profess horror at Mr. Trump raised not a whit of concern when Attorney General Eric Holder denied documents to Congress and was held in contempt. Just politics, they said then… <br/><br/>“If Mrs. Pelosi does choose to brawl over documents, she’s likely to win in court more than she loses. The House in its impeachment power can seek evidence from the executive, and the courts are likely to agree when its requests are reasonable and related to the alleged offenses being investigated. But Mr. Trump may also sometimes prevail if the House is issuing kitchen-sink subpoenas that jeopardize his ability to conduct foreign policy or communicate freely with advisers. No one should be surprised if the White House chooses to fight back, and hard, when Democrats are trying to remove Mr. Trump from office and brand him as ‘impeached’ for 2020.

When Congress held him in contempt, a lot of people thought Holder should wear it as a badge of pride… <br/><br/>“Back then, we could have had a broad bipartisan consensus that even the biggest, dumbest partisan hack is entitled to the full powers and authorities of the office. We could have all agreed that even if a committee chairman has a bigger axe to grind than Paul Bunyan, that didn’t make compliance with requests for documents, subpoenas, or testimony optional… But congressional Democrats and their allies in the media didn’t make that choice. They established the argument that some defiance of Congressional subpoenas is okay, as long as the executive branch believes that the Congressional investigators are being unfair. And now, here we are.”<br/><strong>Jim Geraghty, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday—shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production—imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy. In recent decades, the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment. Did our weapons sales carry a <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/is-trump-locked-and-loaded-for-war-with-iran/">guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom</a> if it gets into a war with its neighbors?… the nation does not want another war.

The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

Trump has no policy agenda. He’s incompetent at improving the lives of American citizens, even his own voters. But he’s good at one thing: waging reality TV personality wars against coastal elites.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=32c53543ab&amp;e=4c7e142432" target="_blank">Beekeeper turns honey-stealing bears into taste testers</a>.<br/><strong>New York Post</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
