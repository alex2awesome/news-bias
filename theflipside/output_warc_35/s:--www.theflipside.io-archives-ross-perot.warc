Trump's brand of populism is far angrier than Perot's ever was. And Perot dealt with slights differently than Trump. When he was called ‘crazy,’ Perot adopted the song ‘Crazy’ as his ‘campaign song,’ even dancing to it.

Perot was married to the same woman for 62 years and was said to be a loyal, if difficult employer (his company had a ‘moral code’ that prohibited infidelity). Trump is the ultimate symbol of excess; Perot bragged about never owning more than three or four pairs of underpants at a time as a young person… Apart from criticism of NAFTA, a protectionist bent, and a general disdain for the two parties, they didn’t have much in common.”<br><strong>Matt Taibbi, Rolling Stone</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Many of Mr. Perot’s predictions about Nafta’s impact — notably his claim of the ‘giant sucking sound’ Americans would hear as businesses shuttered operations in the United States — proved either wrong or overstated.

Perot was never entirely to my taste, but I’m going to miss him. And when I think about his quixotic presidential campaigns, I will always come back to that zinger about how the owners — ‘the people’ — can’t park on Capitol Hill. Go ahead and try to find a space not reserved for the self-important whose salary you pay. You’ll quickly discover how right Perot was; and how little has changed.”<br><strong>Stephen L.

An old-fashioned, soft-spoken Southerner, he nevertheless held views on so-called ‘social issues’ that would be to the left of the mainstream of the Republican Party, both then and now.

His populist attitude against Washington informed the Gingrich-led Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. His fondness for plain-spoken fiscal rectitude popped up again in Al Gore’s Social Security ‘lock box’ and later in the Tea Party. And of course, Perot now looks like the Morning Star of Trumpism… Like Perot, President Trump is also a billionaire populist and a trade protectionist. Trump appeals to the same secular, nationalist voters that were Perot’s base. But Trump also appealed to and made pacts with all the factions of the Republican party.”<br><strong>Michael Brendan Dougherty, National Review </strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://spectator.us/ross-perot-populist-betrayed-populism/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Perot’s allergy to social conservatives was one of the things that would doom his populism</a>… Trump, like Perot, campaigned as something of a moderate on social issues — but he did so without excluding social conservatives, and since becoming president he has served his coalition allies better than many a professed true-believer conservative Republican ever did. Trump also realized, as Perot should have recognized a quarter-century earlier, that third-party politics was a waste of time, when the same resources could be used to take over the GOP from within.”<br><strong>Daniel McCarthy, Spectator USA</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“From the perspective of 2019, H. Ross Perot looks like a key precursor to Trump: the billionaire political outsider who popped up on Larry King Live, opposed free trade deals, and who spoke bluntly and simply and promised to just roll up his sleeves and look under the hood. But <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-complicated-political-legacy-of-h-ross-perot/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">there were some key differences</a>. Perot worried about the deficit — ‘the crazy aunt in the basement’ and about the debt — back when it was a ‘mere’ $5 trillion. He supported means-testing Social Security. His policy interests were not wide but he knew enough about them to give lectures with charts. Perot was feisty but rarely obnoxious.”<br><strong>Jim Geraghty, National Review </strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/07/ross-perot-rip.php" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">What stood out for me about Perot was his raging moderation</a>. Unlike most angry candidates running a populist campaign, Perot was a pragmatist, not an ideologue, and basically a centrist — more so, anyway than his two opponents (which is why Team Bush was wrong, I think, to claim that Perot cost Bush the election; studies have shown that Perot took about as many votes away from Clinton as he did from Bush)… Trump’s political genius, or one aspect of it, was his realization that he could capture the Republican presidential nomination and, eventually, the Republican Party. I wonder how Perot would have fared if he had tried to do the same.”<br><strong>Paul Mirengoff, Power Line Blog </strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“After Republicans lost in 2012, failing to retake the White House and actually losing Senate seats despite a sagging Obama-era economy, two prominent analyses were proposed. One — the Republican National Committee’s ‘autopsy’ — said the GOP’s problem was embracing social issues too much and liberal immigration too little. The other analysis — the ‘Missing White Voter’ thesis — was grounded in actual data. It said the problem was that the GOP of the Bush family and Mitt Romney had turned off working-class whites to the point that they disengaged. Put another way, the GOP establishment in 2012 said the party could win by becoming more like George H.W. Bush; the deeper analysis said it could win if it became more like Ross Perot… <br><br>“Ross Perot didn’t ‘give us Trump.’ But he gave us an insight into what America was really like. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/ross-perot-showed-us-the-hidden-populist-voter" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It just took 20 years for someone to put that insight to use</a>.”<br><strong>Timothy P.
