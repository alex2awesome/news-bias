Since roughly 1850, atmospheric CO2, the dominant greenhouse gas, has grown at an explosive rate, close to what mathematicians call ‘exponential.’ Human population, GDP and fossil fuel emissions accelerated simultaneously in a similar manner… doubling of CO2 from preindustrial levels, which is projected by 2075 — due to the combination of industrial emissions and huge volumes of ancient greenhouse gases rising from melting permafrost – will put the earth at CO2 levels not seen for 35 million years, the last time that Antarctica was ice-free… <br/><br/>“In a fleeting moment of geological time, humanity has fundamentally changed the earth system, bringing life-changing consequences.”<br/><strong>John Brooke, Michael Bevis and Steve Rissing, Time</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Some might criticize Greta and her fellow climate crusaders as zealots or as short sighted, just as many said that about the Parkland students. But even if one disagrees with their proposed solutions, don&#x27;t dismiss the power of children in the streets -- calling for change -- to create an impetus for action. At least once before [in the civil rights era], a children&#x27;s movement was a core inspiration for our country to address its greatest injustices. Today, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/opinions/greta-thunberg-children-moral-clarity-gergen-piltch/index.html">the young speak with moral clarity</a> again.”<br/><strong>David Gergen and James Piltch, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Former vice president Al Gore writes, “We have the technology we need… For example, according to the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance, as recently as 2014 — a year before the Paris climate agreement was reached — electricity from solar and wind was cheaper than new coal and gas plants in probably 1 percent of the world. Today, only five years later, solar and wind provide the cheapest sources of new electricity in two-thirds of the world… To pick [another] example, Google has reduced the amount of electricity required to cool its enormous server farms by 40 percent using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. No new hardware was required… <br/><br/>“[But] <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/opinion/al-gore-climate-change.html">we don’t have the right policies because the wrong policymakers are in charge</a>… Next year’s election is the crucial test of the nation’s commitment to addressing this crisis, and it is worth remembering that on the day after the 2020 election, the terms of the Paris climate accord will permit the United States to withdraw from it. We cannot allow that to happen.”<br/><strong>Al Gore, New York Times</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Former secretary of state John Kerry states, “The need for leadership has never been more urgent; certainly the destruction from Hurricane Dorian and the fires in the Amazon should have refocused everyone’s minds on the fragility of our global carbon sinks.

But today we stand on the precipice of the greatest battle humanity has ever faced, precisely because no one has done enough… <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-kerry-china-and-india-must-step-up-on-climate-change/2019/09/21/b734c270-dbd8-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html">In the temporary absence of U.S. leadership, we need other major emitters to step up</a>… now is the time for China, India and other countries to prove just what we are missing.”<br/><strong>John Kerry, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Others note that “<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155136/what-china-bad-response-climate-crisis">The Chinese government has [already] pledged more than $1 trillion dollars</a> in air, water, and soil cleanup plans, shuttered coal mines throughout the country, capped coal consumption, established a nationwide carbon trading system, poured hundreds of billions of dollars—more than any other country in the world by far—in renewable energy, and promoted the manufacture and sale of electric-vehicles… China has set itself an ambitious agenda. It will not be readily realized. But China, at least, is in the climate game and moving forward… It’s past time for the U.S. to step up.”<br/><strong>Daniel K. Gardner, New Republic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The fundamental injustice of climate change is that… many of the wealthiest countries in the world have historically emitted the most greenhouse gas emissions, but the poorest who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most. That includes island nations like the Bahamas facing rising seas and fiercer storms like Hurricane Dorian, or countries in Southeast Asia suffering from extreme heat waves… The UN has created a number of mechanisms to help correct this discrepancy… it’s worth paying attention to see <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/22/20877222/un-climate-action-summit-2019">how much more developed economies are willing to contribute</a> to these programs.”<br/><strong>Umair Irfan, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

It isn&#x27;t about meaningless international treaties such as the Paris accord, which allow major polluters such as China and India to do nothing on carbon emissions, leave the European Union to do little, and mostly just burden America (which has in most recent years led the world in carbon reductions)…<br/><br/>“When you start instructing people to stop eating meat and flying for vacations, the majority rightly view that as a nonstarter.

Among them, the creation of state-owned banks, affordable housing, ‘local living-wage jobs’ and ‘fully paid quality health care’ for affected populations… The climate strike is all about indoctrination, not science.”<br/><strong>Noah Rothman, New York Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Many argue that “before anyone is tempted to start believing any of these predictions [about climate change], it’s worth recalling that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/environmental-apocalypse-predictions-have-failed-for-half-a-century">similar predictions of impending environmental doom have been made regularly for the past half-century</a>…  Paul Ehrlich, who became famous with publication of The Population Bomb in 1968, regularly predicted global mass starvation by the 1970s and 1980s because of overpopulation and resource depletion. In 1970, Ehrlich predicted that the oceans would be dead in less than a decade, that Americans would face water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980… <br/><br/>“James Hansen of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies beginning in 1988 predicted major droughts and up to six feet of sea level rise in the 1990s… Al Gore predicted in 2009 that the North Pole would be completely ice free in five years. A U.S. Navy scientist in 2013 concluded that the Arctic’s summer sea ice cover would all be melted by 2016… After 50 years of misinformed, misguided, and mistaken predictions, is there any reason to believe that the current prophecies of global warming apocalypse are likely to come true?”<br/><strong>Myron Ebell, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Others propose a “plan [that] is based on the concept of carbon dividends: a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-cut-emissions-without-wrecking-the-economy-11569184262?mod=rsswn">gradually rising fee on all carbon emissions</a>, whose proceeds are returned directly to the American people through quarterly dividend checks. It also calls for significantly simplifying carbon regulations and a border carbon adjustment to protect and promote the competitiveness of American firms… if implemented in 2021 the plan would achieve 50% U.S. CO2 reduction by 2035, as compared with 2005 levels. It would also exceed the 2025 U.S. commitment under the Paris agreement by a wide margin… <br/><br/>“The vast majority of Americans will be economic winners under our plan. According to the U.S. Treasury, 70% of American families—including the most vulnerable—would come out ahead, receiving more in carbon dividends than they pay in increased energy costs… And the more you shrink your carbon footprint, the more you come out ahead. This aligns—for the first time—the economic interests of American families with climate progress.”<br/><strong>Christopher Crane and Ted Halstead, Wall Street Journal</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Others note, “I’d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame. The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels. Trump’s conversation is typically scattershot, wandering all over the field, leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“I think Joe Sixpack’s response is going to be a hearty shrug. After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

As much as Warren is articulate, obviously intelligent, and energetically supported by Democrats, she would also be far easier to defeat than Joe Biden… Considering Trump&#x27;s economy, the president is well placed to defeat Warren.”<br/><strong>Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner </strong></p></div></div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="column-60 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div><div class="column-61 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-7 w-clearfix"><div id="w-node-c9ca80732245-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide center w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div id="w-node-c9ca80732246-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide libertarian w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p><strong>A libertarian&#x27;s take</strong></p><p>“Why did Modi pick this moment to do something so radical? Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods. But sales figures for all consumer goods have posted a precipitous decline, slamming businesses that are dramatically scaling back investments.”<br/><strong>Shikha Dalmia, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://www.insider.com/company-will-pay-1000-to-drink-coffee-from-local-businesses-2019-9" target="_blank">A company will pay you $1,000 to drink coffee for a month</a>— but you&#x27;re not allowed to visit Starbucks.</p><p><strong>Insider</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
