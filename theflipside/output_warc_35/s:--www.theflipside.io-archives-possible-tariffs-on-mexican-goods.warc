How do officials intend to define ‘remedied’?... For that matter, how does Team Trump intend to define ‘illegal’?

But that he chose to take this step while trying to get the USMCA passed is somewhat strange… The administration has insisted that the two issues are unrelated. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on a call Thursday that ‘these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute, these are tariffs as part of an immigration matter, the USMCA is entirely separate.’ But eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers is supposed to be one of the perks of trade agreements, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647195/trump-trade-deal-tariff-mexico-canada-usmca" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">if Trump keeps going around that by invoking national security concerns, the US becomes a far less attractive trading partner</a> to Mexico, Canada, and just about everyone else.”<br><strong>Jen Kirby, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“If you are working in a trade ministry in Brussels, Tokyo or Ottawa, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/upshot/mexico-usa-tariffs-trade.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">how much confidence would you have that any deal you strike with American negotiators will have staying power?</a>...

Our southern neighbor is already helping by agreeing to hold asylum seekers inside Mexico.

That strategy is likelier to succeed if he were to pick off one country or issue at a time, focus on that and have allies to back him up… <br><br>“If winning the battle with China is a top goal, then other battles with players who can help the United States [should] be put aside. That means dropping current trade fights with Japan and the E.U. to enlist their aid in the standoff with China. It also means not picking a new fight with a potential ally as crucial as Mexico when the USMCA is not yet in force… Without Mexican cooperation on China, Beijing could agree to a trade deal with the United States and then circumvent that by signing a separate deal with Mexico… the administration seems incapable of understanding Strategy 101.”<br><strong>Henry Olsen, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Ever since Trump’s new trade war with China, he has had to spend more money bailing out angry farmers hurt by his tariffs than he has taken in revenue from the tariffs themselves. So no, tariffs haven’t worked in fixing problems directly related to trade. But then <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/make-mexico-our-partner-again" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">why does Trump think they will be more effective in solving problems unrelated to trade</a> — specifically, the much thornier issue of immigration?”<br><strong>Editorial Staff, Washington Examiner</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Mexico has played ball with Trump on immigration policy more than anyone would have expected at the outset of his presidency, but <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/trump-tariffs-mexico-bad-idea/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">there are limits to the Mexican government’s effectiveness</a> and its willingness to subordinate its interests to ours… If Trump’s tariff threat gets Mexico to sign such an agreement, we will be the first to congratulate him on his successful brinkmanship. But it is more likely that Mexico will make some assurances that will be enough to get Trump to relent, while not changing anything fundamental on immigration. The worst-case scenario is getting no action from Mexico whatsoever and the imposition of spiraling, disruptive tariffs, whose costs will in fact fall, to a great extent, on Americans.”<br><strong>The Editors, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Supporters of the policy, however, argue, “There are no easy solutions to the ongoing border security crisis, but placing a tariff on Mexican goods will at least force Mexico to take responsibility for its role in creating the problem. At times, the Mexican government has taken steps to prevent the flow of illegal immigrants to the U.S. by discouraging migrants from traveling north. Sadly, however, these efforts have been few and far between. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/31/rogers-trump-mexico-tariffs/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">A tariff on all imports from Mexico will give our southern neighbor a strong incentive</a> to improve its behavior and start making sincere efforts to help Washington solve the illegal immigration crisis once and for all.”<br><strong>Steven Rogers, The Daily Caller</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Such bold action against a key trade partner carries risks.
