Republicans argued the House’s inquiry is a ‘sham process.’ Absent an impeachment resolution, they say, the investigation lacked transparency, due process rights for the president and the validity of a House vote. They had a point. Until now… But perhaps most important, the resolution details the specific roles of committees and members… Several committees and chairmen can, and surely have, made legitimate arguments to be central participants in the impeachment inquiry. This resolution, like any offensive strategy, clearly delineates the role various powerful members and committees will play.”<br/><strong>Joshua C. Huder, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Mr. Trump and his lawyers will have the opportunity to make statements, question witnesses and call their own, with the concurrence of the committee chairman. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=4ba556d233&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">The rules are virtually identical</a> to those adopted by Republicans when they pursued the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 — which makes their breathless claims about a ‘Soviet’ process ludicrous as well as dishonest. One wrinkle is a provision that if Mr. Trump ‘unlawfully’ refuses to make witnesses available or produce documents — as he has so far — the committee chair may restrict the president’s privileges. It seems only reasonable that Mr. Trump should not be allowed to call his own witnesses while blocking those sought by Democrats.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Some note, “Trump’s critics will dismiss the vote as a procedural affair, which is almost always a straight party-line vote in the House. But in other ways, this resolution—merely affirming an impeachment investigation, not judging any articles themselves—should have been the easiest for Republicans to go along with. Instead, lawmakers once again retreated to their corners of comfort. Trump will begin the formal impeachment process with his party still behind him, the House having sent a signal of GOP unity to potential wobblers in the Senate… <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=6c8ddaf706&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">Count this initial vote as a win for the president</a>.”<br/><strong>Russell Berman, The Atlantic</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Regarding the charges themselves, “There’s no question that Trump was deeply involved in pressuring Ukraine. He even released a partial transcript showing it. In Watergate, everyone knew there was a crime, and the question was who did it. In the Ukraine scandal, everyone knows who did it. The only debate is whether it’s a crime, or perhaps a high crime… In earlier stages of the process, Republicans and Trump defenders could hide behind a series of excuses: The whistle-blower didn’t have firsthand knowledge, or there wasn’t really a quid pro quo, or the Ukrainians didn’t understand it as a quid pro quo, or maybe Trump didn’t know what was going on. But <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=8d8967c369&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">the testimony has shredded each of these</a>, as witnesses with direct knowledge speak and more becomes clear about the Ukrainian side and Trump’s own involvement.”<br/><strong>David A. Graham, The Atlantic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The evidence that has surfaced thus far indicates that Trump orchestrated a mob-style shakedown, withholding nearly $400 million in military aid and a promised White House meeting in an attempt to coerce Zelensky into investigating — and publicly smearing — Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The play-ball-with-us message was apparently delivered not just by the president himself but also by various emissaries… In other words, Trump was actively and personally colluding with a foreign government to interfere in our coming presidential election.<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=41200ff7f9&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank"> No wonder Republicans prefer to pound the table about process</a>.”<br/><strong>Eugene Robinson, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The argument is often made that Trump has done wrong but that our marathon course should run through the voting booth, not the impeachment process: Let the electorate make the call. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=c8f32c0b36&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">This argument leaves me incredulous </a>given where we are in the course of events. The president appears to have attempted to direct the considerable powers of his office toward eroding the integrity of the electoral process. This is like saying that we should let the outcome of the boxing match determine whether the guy accused of having lead in his gloves has lead in his gloves.”<br/><strong>Danielle Allen, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Impeachment and removal remain <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=17621c5cf7&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">extraordinary remedies for extraordinary misconduct</a> by the president of the United States. But the founders would have been appalled at the suggestion that such measures are illegitimate solely because their result would be that the president is no longer the president.

The earliest tick the Ukrainians knew the aid was being delayed was ‘early August’ and even that is based on anonymous media sources who somehow have not been found to testify. Official U.S. and Ukrainian officials instead say knowledge the funds were held up didn’t get to the Ukrainians until late August, shortly before they were released…<br/><br/>“[Furthermore] nothing happened. Trump never asked the attorney general to contact Zelensky. It is unclear who if anyone Guiliani spoke with, but either way the Ukrainians never investigated anything. This impeachment will be the first in American history without any underlying actual crime taking place on the ground.”<br/><strong>Peter Van Buren, The American Conservative</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Democrats want to impeach Mr. Trump for asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival for corruption, though the probe never happened, and for withholding aid to Ukraine that in the end wasn’t withheld.

It leaves the wrong committee largely in charge of the process; it affords Republican congressmen too little opportunity to call witnesses; it keeps too many of the proceedings behind closed doors; and it still does not provide any specifics as to when and how the president’s own counsel will be allowed to rebut allegations against him. If this is how the impeachment investigation will proceed, it will fail to persuade large portions of the public that the allegations are legitimate.”<br/><strong>Quin Hillyer, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“The House Democratic caucus has 233 members.

To get Mr. Sixpack’s attention you are going to have to do better than this.”<br/><strong>Kyle Smith, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-won-the-debate-trump-should-be-happy" target="_blank">President Trump should be happy</a>.

If the government actually managed to collect it, their fortunes would rapidly erode — and so would tax collections.
