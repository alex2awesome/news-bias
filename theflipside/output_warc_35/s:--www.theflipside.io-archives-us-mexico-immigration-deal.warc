That program sends migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are being processed… <br><br>“[Other] key aspects of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Mexico has pledged to buy more U.S. agricultural products and if the deal materially expanded a previous commitment by Mexico to more vigorously police its southern border with Guatemala.” <strong>Reuters</strong></p></div><a href="/archives" class="link-6">See past issues</a></div></div><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82d95c45605590f6387_bear-badge.png" width="114" alt="" class="image archives"/><div class="columns w-row"><div class="blue-divider w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-6"><div class="div-block-2"></div></div><div class="red-divider w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-6"><div class="div-block-3"></div></div></div><div class="div-block-38"><div class="columns-15 w-row"><div class="column-60 w-clearfix w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"><h1 class="from-the-left-heading">From the Left</h1><div class="paragraph-6 left intro w-richtext"><p data-w-id="393436f9-7130-b81f-725e-7ef3a4decc97">The left is critical of Trump’s negotiating tactics, and argues that this deal will not solve the underlying problems with the immigration system.<br data-w-id="46cfb2f7-1239-eedf-1b5c-434497214c40"></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet first w-richtext"><p>“The whole point of trade deals is that they’re supposed to provide some certainty. The USMCA, like NAFTA, amounts to a promise by all three participants that they won’t arbitrarily impose new barriers to cross-border trade. Then Trump went ahead and threatened major new tariffs on Mexico, not because it had violated its trade agreements, but because he didn’t like something that was happening on the border, a situation that has nothing to do with trade policy. So the USMCA appears, in practice, to be a solemn promise by the U.S. government not to impose tariffs on Mexican products … unless it feels like it.

It was <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/08/trump-trade-deals-mexico-china-1358155" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">eerily reminiscent of the president’s threat in late March to close the U.S. southern border</a> if Mexico didn’t stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs into the United States — only to back down six days later and issue Mexico a ‘one-year warning’ instead.”<br><strong>Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook, Politico</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Nine days in spring offered a case study in Mr. Trump’s approach to some of the most daunting issues confronting him and the nation: When the goal seems frustratingly out of reach through traditional means, threaten drastic action, set a deadline, demand concessions, cut a deal — real or imagined — avert the dire outcome and declare victory. If nothing else, he forces attention on the issue at hand. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/a-drama-of-trumps-own-making-ends-with-a-familiar-hero.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Whether the approach yields sustainable results seems less certain</a>…<br><br>“Even after the deal was struck on Friday night, the Business Roundtable issued a statement essentially asking Mr. Trump not to do it again, describing itself as ‘deeply concerned about the threat or imposition of tariffs to press policy changes with our neighbors and allies.’ Business, after all, likes certitude, predictability.

Attack Biden… Many progressives are understandably fearful that attacking the presumptive frontrunner might weaken him and give Trump ammunition for the general election. But challenging Biden’s record is important. For example, his core base of support – older Democrats – needs to know what an unreliable defender of Social Security and Medicare he is. By challenging him on his record, especially in the eyes of older, traditional Democratic voters, progressives could break the myth of Biden’s ‘electability’. (A strange trope given that Biden has tried and failed to be a presidential nominee since the 1980s.)… Anyone angling to be the Democratic nominee should espouse a real progressive agenda – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/want-to-defeat-trump-attack-biden" target="_blank">just being ‘anti-Trump’ isn’t enough</a>.”<br/><strong>Bhaskar Sunkara, The Guardian</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“For Warren or anyone else to prevent the uniquely depressing experience of a Biden ‘national unity’ campaign, specifically targeted at a tiny cadre of wobbly Trump voters and Jeff Flake-style dissident Republicans, something has to change before next winter.

It will free up valuable Border Patrol resources. It will save American taxpayers billions of dollars that otherwise would have been used to fund the many social programs, medical care, housing, education and incarceration (among other things) for illegal immigrants in the United States. If Mexico follows through on this agreement, the Border Patrol will finally stop being a quasi-social services agency. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/brandon-judd-trump-and-america-are-winners-by-getting-mexico-to-intensify-fight-against-illegal-immigration" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">We will once again become a law enforcement agency</a>.

Assume for a moment that they know, generally, that tariffs are a lousy idea in terms of economic growth. Assume as well that they know that tariffs can be an instrument of national power in confrontations unrelated to economic growth… <br><br>“Assume that voters know our competition with China is far more than an economic race, but rather a complex geopolitical rivalry that both sides wish to keep contained short of open conflict and that is waged through proxies, cyber-confrontations, intellectual-property battles, freedom-of-the-seas disputes and the relative size and power of our armed forces and those of our allies. In that context, tariffs on Chinese goods are just part of an overall negotiation toward a new normal that is in everyone’s interest. So <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/08/with-mexico-deal-trump-deals-another-blow-media-elites/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ceade182bd18" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">‘tariffs bad, free trade good’ is simplistic</a>. ‘Free trade is good and agreed-upon international conventions are required for genuinely free trade and tariffs may be necessary to achieve those conventions’ is accurate. And widely understood.”<br><strong>Hugh Hewitt, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Critics, however, argue, “These changes may reduce the migrant wave from Central America, which reached as many as 1,500 people a day in late May. But the underlying incentive of lax U.S. asylum law will still attract migrants whether or not they have to stay for a time in Mexico. Fixing that loophole is Congress’s job, but Democrats refuse to act. Yet by focusing so much on Mexico as the cause of the border mess, and now declaring diplomatic victory, Mr. Trump is taking the political pressure off Democrats to act on immigration… <br><br>“The use of tariffs to achieve non-trade goals is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-for-mexicos-wall-11560118396" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">bad policy that won’t stop with immigration</a>… Now that Mr. Trump is using tariffs as an all-purpose weapon, look for others to play the same game. Joe Biden’s climate proposal, released last week, suggests using tariffs against countries that don’t do what he wants on climate change. The danger is that future Presidents will also view tariffs as a diplomatic remedy for whatever ails them. Congress would do well to take back the ‘emergency’ and ‘national security’ blank checks on trade that it has given Presidents over the decades.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“If Joe Biden can win his way through the primaries, <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-and-hillary-clinton-generate-very-different-emotional-responses-from-republicans/" target="_blank">he’s almost lab-engineered to beat Trump</a>. He doesn’t cause Republican panic, he has the potential to connect with white working-class voters in a way that Hillary couldn’t in 2016, and he has a potential to connect better with black voters than Hillary did… if Biden emerges from [this] crucible, Trump will face a very different challenge than he faced in 2016.”<br/><strong>David French, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div class="w-row"><div class="column-60 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div><div class="column-61 w-col w-col-6 w-col-small-6 w-col-tiny-tiny-stack"></div></div><div class="w-layout-grid grid-7 w-clearfix"><div id="w-node-c9ca80732245-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide center w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div id="w-node-c9ca80732246-d549fb85" class="paragraph-6 wide libertarian w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p><strong>A libertarian&#x27;s take</strong></p><p>“The relevant question is not the nationality of a source offering ‘oppo research’ but <a href="https://reason.com/2019/06/13/is-accepting-information-about-a-political-opponent-from-a-foreigner-an-assault-on-our-democracy/" target="_blank">the accuracy and relevance of the information</a>. Another consideration is whether the information was obtained illegally—by hacking emails, for example. While the Supreme Court has said people have a First Amendment right to share illegally obtained information if they were not involved in the lawbreaking (something that news organizations frequently do), you might reasonably argue that they should also report such crimes when they become aware of them, which may be what Trump had in mind when he said he might contact the FBI ‘if I thought there was something wrong.’”<br/><strong>Jacob Sullum, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>California restaurant offers <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/free-pizza-locked-up-smartphones" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">free pizza to diners who lock away their phones</a>.</p><p>‍<strong>Fox News</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
