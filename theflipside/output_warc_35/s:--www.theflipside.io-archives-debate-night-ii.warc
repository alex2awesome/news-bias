Booker spoke powerfully about criminal justice reform and immigration. And he made a very good point when he noted that Biden was trying to have it both ways when it came to former President Barack Obama -- taking credit when it works for him and distancing himself from the Obama legacy when that is more politically convenient. Booker has considerable natural gifts as a candidate -- and they shone through on Wednesday night.”<br><strong>Chris Cillizza, CNN</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“New Jersey Sen.

Harris has struggled throughout the campaign to give clear answers on key questions, like whether private plans should be permitted under Medicare-for-all, and her campaign’s new proposal seemed to be designed to settle those doubts once and for all. Biden, on the other hand, appeared to casually mix up copays with deductibles in one of his debate answers… The core disagreement between the two leading candidates on the stage remained the same from beginning to end: Harris wants to fundamentally overhaul the system to cover everyone and Biden wants to build on the system we have to cover many more, but not all, people.”<br><strong>Dylan Scott, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Harris, for her part, was <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/joe-biden-is-either-lucky-or-better-than-we-thought.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">unable to replicate her dominating star turn of the first debate</a>… She seemed more hesitant, and her answers on health care continue to sound unclear, though she recovered in the second half of the debate. Harris and Booker have the same problem: they need Joe Biden to collapse, and for the moment, that isn’t happening.”<br><strong>Jonathan Chait, New York Magazine</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joe-biden-was-adequate-thats-a-victory/2019/07/31/bc5ddb80-b3f9-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html?utm_term=.d3ab4030574f" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Biden was . . . perfectly adequate</a>. He wasn’t the most eloquent or stylish debater on the stage. He struggled to find words at times, he seemed over-rehearsed, he seemed not to grasp how texting works (‘Go to Joe 30330’), he cut himself off when his allotted time expired and, at times, he seemed stunned by the ferocity of the barrage — which, in fairness, was stunning. But in contrast to his lifeless performance at the first debate, Biden was energetic and prepared. He returned fire with fire and, for the most part, he held his own.”<br><strong>Dana Milbank, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Biden isn’t the only one trying to have it both ways on Obama… The candidates were all quick to praise Obama the man even as they seemed to be running against certain Obama policies…<br><br>“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/democrats-want-have-it-both-ways-barack-obama/595270/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It’s surprising to see Obama almost discarded as a party asset</a>, given that it’s been less than three years since he left office, and that he remains very popular—63 percent of Americans approve of him, Gallup found in 2018. More to the point, almost nine in 10 Democrats approve of Obama. The Democratic Party is moving leftward, and there’s a vocal faction in the primary in favor of more progressive policies. But it’s probably not a coincidence that the candidate who is tying himself most closely to the former president—Joe Biden—continues to lead the polls. To borrow a phrase, it may be that Obama is still likable enough.”<br><strong>David A. Graham, The Atlantic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

But if Biden is the lone defender of the Obama legacy, and every other upstart is painting the previous presidency as a failure, maybe Obama will come out and formally endorse his old wingman.”<br><strong>Jim Geraghty, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Biden “has decided that you cannot beat Donald Trump with a program of open borders and killing private health insurance.

Which, by the by, will strengthen his hand if he faces Trump, because he’ll be able to point to the real fight he had with the progressive wing of his party on this issue. He’ll say that he faced them down and won. ‘Open borders’ would come off the table as a serious Republican weapon… <br><br>“Harris got positively slaughtered on healthcare, because she now occupies a No Man’s Land where she wants to kill private insurance, but not for ten years. So if you’re the type of Democrat who really wants to kill the insurance companies, why would you settle for her? And if you’re the type of Democrat who thinks that maybe we should keep private insurance around as a fail-safe, then you don’t want what she’s selling.”<br><strong>Jonathan V.

She was challenged over her immigration plan to effectively decriminalize illegal immigrant border crossings. She was challenged over her record as California attorney general. There, Tulsi Gabbard went for the jugular on Harris' record with regards to drug crimes and sentence length… Repeatedly challenged over her plan's removal of the right to employer based healthcare coverage, Harris was uncertain. She tried to change the subject, but it didn't work. And it didn't work for a simple reason: because Harris knows she cannot pretend her healthcare plan is anything other than what it is: a slightly milder version of Bernie Sanders' socialist plan.”<br><strong>Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/01/dem-debate-gop-strategists-roundup-2-227496" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Trump won tonight</a>… Biden looked old and disconnected. Harris looked nervous and unprepared. And all of [the candidates] moved further to the left in their positions… Over the past two nights, almost every one of these candidates has been so blindly focused on winning the nomination that they have completely ignored what general-election voters will think of the positions they’re taking.

Violence in Kashmir had been trending downwards for the last year, after all. The main reason, besides President Donald Trump&#x27;s alarming offer to mediate a settlement, is that <a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/19/why-the-crackdown-in-kashmir/" target="_blank">he wanted a distraction from India&#x27;s mounting economic woes</a>. India&#x27;s GDP growth dropped from over 8 percent to 5.8 percent over the last year, and it is widely expected to dip further. Just as ominous has been the crash in consumer demand. India&#x27;s usual problem has been an insufficient supply to meet its voracious appetite for vehicles, cell phones, and other similar goods.
