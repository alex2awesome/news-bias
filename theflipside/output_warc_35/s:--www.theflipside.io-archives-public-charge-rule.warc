No rational government of a country with millions of immigrants would want millions of immigrant children to show up at school hungry each morning because their parents are afraid to apply for food stamps. No rational government would want hundreds of thousands of immigrant families to risk homelessness because of a temporary dip in their financial situation. Simply out of self-interest, a country such as the United States cannot afford to drive millions of<em> legal </em>immigrants entirely outside the social safety net.”<br><strong>Sasha Abramsky, The Nation</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The Labor Department reports that seven million jobs are going unfilled even as the economy is slowing… Foreign-born workers include surgeons, computer engineers and financiers, and also those working in restaurant kitchens and driving cabs, doing the less desirable jobs at the lowest wages. But they contribute to the growth of the nation, and if some of them need help at some point with housing or food stamps, it’s a bargain in the long term. The economic return makes immigration a great investment for the nation. Which is why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/opinion/immigrants-raids-public-charge.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Mr. Trump’s public charge rule is bad for all Americans</a>, not just those who strive to become one.”<br><strong>Bill Saporito, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“[The rule] won’t attract greater numbers of better-heeled, success-bound applicants. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-approach-to-screening-immigrants-only-leaves-the-us-worse-off/2019/08/14/53fdf164-be13-11e9-9b73-fd3c65ef8f9c_story.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">it will radically slash the total number of immigrants gaining legal admission</a>. And it will deprive the U.S. economy of badly needed workers of the sort who have a long track record of upward mobility… The fact remains that less-well-heeled immigrants fill jobs for which there are insufficient native-born applicants; they perform well in those jobs and move up the income bracket. The administration’s new rules, while complex — they exempt pregnant women, asylum seekers, refugees, military service personnel and others — would drastically expand the pool of those who could be denied legal permanent residency based on poor predictors of future success.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“By signaling that the huddled masses are no longer welcome while others in the administration (particularly Jared Kushner) continue to advocate for the types of visas favored in Silicon Valley, Team Trump spins this as advocating not for ‘zero immigration,’ but for the ‘right kind of immigration’… [But] ‘the president has made it more difficult—and expensive—to hire high-skilled tech workers from other countries. The administration has throttled a program that encouraged entrepreneurs to come to the U.S. It’s also ending work permits for spouses of H-1B holders, who are often highly skilled professionals themselves.’ As a result of the administration’s efforts, there was a 10 percent decline in H-1Bs issued last year… <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/154755/pretzel-logic-trumps-immigration-policy" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It isn’t just about dissuading the tired and poor from coming, it’s about telling everyone to stay away</a>.”<br><strong>Alex Shephard, New Republic</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The long-run structure of the American welfare state, which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly, requires a growing population and economy. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/3/14624918/the-case-for-immigration" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Immigrants contribute to both goals</a>… Going forward, demographers forecast that immigration — both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise — is the only reason America’s working-age population isn’t declining. This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants’ work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans’ childbearing as well… That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores — and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so — is an enormous source of national strength. It’s time we started to see it that way.”<br><strong>Matthew Yglesias, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>Some suggest that Congress “remove Trump from office, so that he cannot abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process, but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term… Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference. At the same time, letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump, despite his attempt to subvert the system, should have another chance… <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/25/congress-should-remove-trump-from-office-but-let-him-run-again-228228">Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus</a>.

In other words, an immigrant using food stamps, Medicaid, free school lunch, and public housing — but not cash benefits such as TANF or SSI — was to be considered self-supporting… Immigrants shouldn’t just use welfare less than the native-born — ideally, they shouldn’t use it at all.”<br><strong>Mark Krikorian, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“This approach is rooted in the common sense notion that <a href="https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/08/trump-administration-tightens-public-charge-rule.php" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">immigrants should support themselves, not burden taxpayers</a>. If they can’t support themselves, they should leave… However, the rule isn’t draconian. It applies to ‘an alien who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period.’ Receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months. Thus, immigrants in dire straits can seek assistance of the types addressed in the new rule. Their status will be in jeopardy only if they remain on it for a year or more, total, during a three-year period. And even if they do, they won’t automatically be denied green cards. Other factors will be considered in assessing the likelihood that an immigrant who has used welfare extensively will be granted status.”<br><strong>Paul Mirengoff, Power Line Blog</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>Some, however, argue “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-public-charge-ploy-11565738249" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">there’s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding</a>, and the DHS rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions… most immigrants don’t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years. Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a ‘public charge’ based on arbitrary levels of income, employment, education and English proficiency… <br><br>“While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute, DHS is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own. And wouldn’t you know, the rule bears a striking resemblance to the ‘merit-based’ system that restrictionists in the White House have proposed but can’t get Congress to pass. If this sounds like Barack Obama ’s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change, that’s because it is.”<br><strong>Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Congress passed a law decades ago establishing that potential immigrants likely to become a ‘public charge’ should not be permitted to enter the country. That makes some sense: A new resident should be able to add to, not detract from, the existing community’s economic resources. The problem is that Congress did not do its job and clearly establish when an aspiring immigrant meets or fails that test… <br><br>“The rule announced on Monday is 837 pages long. It needed to address all the thorny issues Congress avoided and makes a roomful of contentious value judgments along the way… <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/13/dont-like-trumps-new-public-charge-rule-blame-congress-shirking-its-duty/?noredirect=on" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">This is a problem inherent in what conservative lawyers call ‘the administrative state.’</a> Congress passes laws that amount to mere statements of intent, avoiding the difficult choices that invite scrutiny and make enemies. It passes the buck to executive agencies, which then must make the value judgments and trade-offs via processes largely behind closed doors… Judicial oversight is no substitute for congressional abdication. Judges are not equipped to make the moral or technical judgments such laws in all but name require.”<br><strong>Henry Olsen, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/sorry-but-its-not-racist-to-screen-out-migrants-wholl-be-a-burden/" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">This isn’t about race</a>… the story of immigration to the United States has always been about people of every race, color and creed who come here to work and take advantage of American freedoms and opportunity — not a desire to take advantage of the welfare state… Even if you don’t share administration hard-liners’ desire to cut back legal immigration, ­emphasizing merit is a common-sense concern that is supported by most Americans. Our culture is rooted in self-sufficiency and individual initiative. Our immigration system should reflect our national creed.”<br><strong>Jonathan S.
