Not only do we encourage primary challenges, we urge any conservative spoiling for a fight to press a third-party candidacy in the general election.

Ben Sasse isn’t going to do this. Nikki Haley isn’t going to do this. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan isn’t going to do this. Every Never Trumper is, by now, presumed to understand this. When having something to lose is a disqualifier, that leaves only the quixotic and the has-beens… One of the many problems with Trump is that he presents a sort of Catch-22: An adversary can be a responsible adult (and let Trump roll over you), or can try to emulate Trump’s worst qualities (and then, Trumpism wins). Of course, few people—even if they try—have the ability to effectively wrestle with Trump in the muck…<br><br>“Whether it involves tangling in a debate, or (more likely) trolling on Twitter, Joe Walsh, for all his baggage (maybe because of his baggage?), might be temperamentally better suited to this type of battle. So, yes, there is a certain irony involved in having someone with a sketchy reputation emerge as our would-be savior—but that’s because <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-are-the-gops-heavyweights-afraid-to-run-against-trump?ref=wrap" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">only a certain type of personality is crazy enough to volunteer for a suicide mission</a>.”<br><strong>Matt Lewis, The Daily Beast</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Do Democrats want to share a ‘bed’ with people who have supported President Donald Trump until recently? The answer should be a resounding yes… Trump supporters probably will never listen to Democrats, but these former Trump super fans might be effective at reaching those on the right who have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Trump… <br><br>“Walsh, a radio show host since losing reelection in 2012 and a frequent guest on cable news, could be effective in reaching rank-and-file Republicans, since he speaks their language. For example, Walsh was a Tea Party Republican when the Tea Party was known for championing lower federal budget deficits. In contrast, under Trump, the deficit is exploding… The 2020 election likely will be a nail biter. In other words, if [criticism from] Scaramucci and Walsh <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/25/opinions/joe-walsh-anthony-scaramucci-2020-democrats-obeidallah/index.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">can help peel off even a small percentage of votes from Trump</a>, that might be just enough to defeat him.

I said some ugly things about President Obama that I regret.’ That is, of course, putting it mildly considering Walsh didn’t just question Obama’s birth certificate, he also said he was secretly a Muslim and also seemed to call for violence when he said he’d be grabbing his ‘musket’ if Trump lost the election against Hillary Clinton. And those are just a few examples. There are many more.”<br><strong>Daniel Politi, Slate</strong><br></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/25/20829628/joe-walsh-president-gop-2020-primary-donald-trump-supporter-conspiracy-theorist-birtherism" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">It’s not exactly clear which Republican constituency would find Walsh appealing</a>: Republican voters turned off by Trump’s own conspiracy theorizing and racism are unlikely to support another Republican prone to the same, his current disavowals of such behavior notwithstanding, and Republican voters who don’t find Trump’s invective unappealing will simply vote for him again.”<br><strong>Jane Coaston and Sean Collins, Vox</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"><p>“Trump’s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial.

Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange.’… </p><h6>‍</h6><p>“In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation.

In short, Walsh’s background is extremely similar, and in some ways identical, to that which purportedly is the reason Americans should toss Trump out… The willingness of some anti-Trumpers to tolerate Walsh… places their criticisms into perspective. Apparently, it’s okay when they wrestle with difficult moral decisions and decide to overlook the obvious and apparent unfitness of a man to become president, but it’s not okay when many conservatives look at a flawed president and make reluctant but rational decisions they disagree with.”<br><strong>Henry Olsen, Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“It’s fairly typical for politicians to change their positions over time for expediency.
