But after Ms. Gillibrand’s big announcement in January, her expensively laid plans unraveled as those potential contributors all but vanished… Her campaign says she is connecting one voter at a time in coffee shops and living rooms. But in a celebrity-fueled climate dominated by mass media and viral moments online, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-abortion.html" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">it is not clear such a pathway exists in 2020</a>.”<br><strong>Shane Goldmacher, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“The modern media environment favors the flashy over the wonkish.

None of that has translated into anything close to a first-place showing in the polls. Nor has it garnered much media attention.

At one point, Wallace pressed Gillibrand to explain a tweet… emphasizing that the future was female and intersectional. ‘What do you mean our future is female?’ he asked. ‘We want women to have a seat at the table,’ Gillibrand replied. ‘But what about men?’ Wallace asked, seemingly suggesting that her message could imply some kind of exclusion, a common fear that’s been expressed about movements that advance people who have historically been underrepresented in different fields… <br data-w-id="09ed7a90-3a70-4687-7d20-974f6fdc5ef8"><br data-w-id="33c06c29-1552-d6dc-a660-847bc11f5c42">“‘They’re already there!

To suggest that men don’t already have a seat at the table would mean ignoring those facts. Yet as different groups work to address existing gaps, it’s prompted concern among some people who’ve traditionally dominated certain fields.

The ‘terror watch list’ issue had more to with that being an unadjudicated (and vastly overused) status developed by law enforcement without any recourse to due process. Even some of the people who develop those lists think it’s potentially dangerous to counterterrorism efforts to conflate its use with gun control. Also, Gillibrand accuses the NRA of torpedoing the banning of ‘bump stocks,’ used in the Las Vegas massacre, when Donald Trump himself banned bump stocks last year… <br><br>“When she represented only ‘my rural upstate district,’ Gillibrand was more than happy to wave the NRA flag. When it came time to run for statewide office, Gillibrand changed her position to suit her political needs.

Gillibrand has referred to Trump’s immigration and border security policies as racist on multiple occasions, despite previously promulgating identical positions — she contended in January that those same positions were not racist when she supported them.

Another consideration is whether the information was obtained illegally—by hacking emails, for example. While the Supreme Court has said people have a First Amendment right to share illegally obtained information if they were not involved in the lawbreaking (something that news organizations frequently do), you might reasonably argue that they should also report such crimes when they become aware of them, which may be what Trump had in mind when he said he might contact the FBI ‘if I thought there was something wrong.’”<br/><strong>Jacob Sullum, Reason</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p data-w-id="43972099-6b6b-b712-6bfa-e3ef7376a7bd"><a data-w-id="c2dd30c4-3f44-4090-fd05-a7314898da86" href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/02/up-to-25-cups-of-coffee-a-day-safe-for-heart-health-study-finds" target="_blank" data-rt-link-type="external">Up to 25 cups of coffee a day safe for heart health</a>, study finds. </p><p data-w-id="22960b19-3a94-608d-5260-e995e88a6a81">‍<strong data-w-id="4b30adf7-dff4-aedf-ce4d-7c3d77f97f59">The Guardian</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
