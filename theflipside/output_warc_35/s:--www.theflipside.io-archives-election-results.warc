By 2019, that gerrymander was dead, killed off by the courts… Tuesday’s blowout demonstrates that there’s no mysterious or insurmountable hurdle that organically prevents Democrats from translating a landslide (in overall votes) into a majority in the General Assembly. The problem was not that Democratic voters tend to cluster in urban regions, as some Republicans have long claimed. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=436c3a1334&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">The problem was illicit redistricting</a>.

More broadly: Railing against impeachment and attacking Democrats as ‘socialists’ won’t get the job done for Republicans when the GOP finds itself on the wrong end of questions such as health care and education… Trump’s failure to rally Republicans with his anti-impeachment message in Kentucky — a state the president carried by 30 points and that is home to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), up for reelection next year — should give Republicans pause about a Trump-centric approach to their own political futures… Voters want elections to be about them, not the narcissist in the White House.”<br/><strong>E.J. Dionne Jr., Washington Post</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“Matt Bevin made it his top priority as governor to shred the ACA… He shifted 31,000 people off Medicaid and S-Chip, the state children’s health-insurance plan. He added work requirements for Medicaid, and other practical barriers to coverage.

Squeezing the ACA has been Trump policy, too. Nationwide, Medicaid and S-Chip enrollment has declined by 1.7 million over the past two years, a decline too big to be explained solely by improvements in the job market…Trump is a historically unpopular president, delivering a historically unpopular agenda.

One glance at the other statewide races tells the tale: As Mr. Trump himself tweeted Wednesday morning, all were won handily by Republicans. <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=40ad785d66&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">Mr. McConnell’s fabled political organization appears to remain intact</a>… those breaking out the bourbon in the belief that Trump Fever is abating in Kentucky should put away their glasses.”<br/><strong>Jason Kyle Howard, New York Times</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>“<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=35197756de&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">The real winners [were] Medicaid expansion and education</a>… Republicans in Arizona, Oklahoma and elsewhere have seen that tangling with teachers usually doesn’t work out well; they’ve also learned that as much as they may dislike the Affordable Care Act, it’s a political nightmare to mess with. Every time an election like this happens, it makes politicians more likely to heed those lessons.”<br/><strong>Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 left bullet w-richtext"><p>Finally, “There&#x27;s been much discussion of the Republican Party&#x27;s high-profile losses on Tuesday in Kentucky and Virginia, but <a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=76401ac993&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">historic GOP losses in Pennsylvania might be more concerning for the party in 2020</a>… Pennsylvania is a key swing state that went for President Donald Trump in 2016 and will be a central battleground state in 2020.

His abrasive style turned off voters and legislators alike. These weaknesses were likely the biggest factor in his loss to Beshear… <br/><br/>“[Moreover] until Bevin’s election in 2015, Democrats had held the governorship in Kentucky for almost the entirety of the past two decades. Though Bevin’s loss isn’t a great sign for the GOP, it also isn’t evidence that the party is collapsing in Kentucky, especially given that the other five major statewide contests last night went to Republicans. Republican attorney-general candidate Daniel Cameron, for instance, defeated his Democratic opponent by about 15 points, and in the process raked in well over 100,000 more votes than either Bevin or Beshear. Every other GOP candidate on the ballot won his or her contest by at least 15 points.”<br/><strong>Alexandra DeSanctis, National Review</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Given how close this race was — Bevin lost by less than 5,000 votes — it&#x27;s understandable he&#x27;d want a recount, or a recanvass at the very least, to ensure that all the tallies were conducted correctly. But as soon as that process is complete,<a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=9968a8b491&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank"> Bevin should put an end to this chaos and concede</a>. If he doesn’t, he risks becoming the next Stacey Abrams, the failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate, who to this day pretends she was robbed of the governorship despite losing to Gov. Brian Kemp by over 50,000 votes… <br/><br/>“Instead of admitting her loss, Abrams vilified Kemp and encouraged the creation of a myth that voter suppression somehow caused her narrow defeat. Republicans rightly criticized Abrams for playing the victim and abandoning individual responsibility. They should now demand the same from Bevin, who is crying foul play without evidence, just like Abrams. Bevin lost the Kentucky race not because Democrats skewed the results, but because he was so deeply unpopular among his own red-leaning electorate that they chose a Democrat instead.”<br/><strong>Kaylee McGhee, Washington Examiner</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“Democrats watched to their dismay as the political reaction to Barack Obama’s polarizing governance cost them the House, most governorships and state legislatures, and finally the Senate and the White House.

The GOP under Mr. Trump is losing more college-educated suburban voters, especially women, than it is gaining rural voters or working-class former Democrats… <br/><br/>“The fair judgment a year from Election Day in 2020 is that Mr. Trump is highly vulnerable in his bid for a second term. He could benefit if the economy rebounds from its recent 2% rate of growth, and perhaps Democrats bent on impeachment will overreach. But Mr. Trump may need Democrats to nominate an opponent whose agenda is far enough to the left to scare suburban voters who are tired of the daily melodrama of the Trump Presidency.”<br/><strong>Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal</strong><br/></p></div><div class="paragraph-6 right bullet w-richtext"><p>“A down-on-its-heels, opioid-ravaged, working-class, alienated electorate found its champion in Trump… Trump has made Trump voters, but not <em>Republicans</em>, out of working-class independents and Democrats, and he has made<em>Democratic</em> voters out of independents and Republicans.

The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by, for instance, mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels.

After <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wheres-the-smoking-gun/">all that has emerged about Trump so far</a>, his approval rating is closely tracking Obama’s approval at the same point in his presidency.

Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn’t necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren’s plan would actually cost.”<br/><strong>Megan McArdle, Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div><div class="additional-closing w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="on-the-bright-side"><h4 class="heading-18">On the bright side...</h4><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><a href="https://theflipside.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=281c839c990f42b374467ae5f&amp;id=0aaf4c0311&amp;e=6f16cb1c23" target="_blank">650 people formed a human chain to move children’s books from one library to another</a>.<br/><strong>Washington Post</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class="trollcta archive w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="div-block-26 archive"><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5bfd76c121f9503755c665f9/5bfee82bbe4cd8508983a309_bear-0.png" alt="" class="bearhead archive"/><h2 class="heading-cta archive">Get troll-free political news.</h2></div></div><div class="w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="w-clearfix w-form"><form id="email-form-2" name="email-form-2" data-name="Email Form 2" class="form-4 faq"><input type="email" class="email-address-field-grey hero faq archive w-input" maxlength="256" name="hero-optin-2" data-name="Hero Optin 2" placeholder="your email address" id="hero-optin-2" required=""/><input type="submit" value="I want the best points from both sides        &gt;" data-wait="Please wait..." class="submit-button hero home faq archive w-button"/></form><div class="w-form-done"><div>Thank you!
